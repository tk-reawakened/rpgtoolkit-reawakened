/**
 * Entry 9.5's browser limb: the cue player and the PCM sink running together in headless Chromium, on real authored WAV
 * fixtures.
 *
 * The three runner rules are asserted as facts, not listened to: the autoplay unlock is a **delayed late start** (the
 * music joins at `(gesture − cue) mod length`), the 15-tick drop is measured **at ready** (lateness 14 starts at 14;
 * lateness 15 is stopped, never played, never ended), and the focus hold pauses then resumes with its position intact.
 * The sound itself is asserted by the sink's own pull — the same call the audio graph makes — so the lane can tell
 * silence from sound without a speaker. A real graph is attached too; with the autoplay policy disabled for the lane,
 * the analyser reading is non-silent and its duration is asserted against the fixture length.
