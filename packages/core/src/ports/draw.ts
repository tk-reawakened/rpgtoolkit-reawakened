/**
 * The draw list: a flat, ordered, plain-data replay of one frame (AD-3, AD-11).
 *
 * A `DrawList` is rebuilt every frame with no deltas and is a pure function of
 * current state, so it hashes: `canon`/`hashDrawList` cover the commands and
 * the surface `rev` numbers they reference, never pixel bytes. Renderers only
 * replay it top to bottom and hold no game state (G4).
 *
 * Coordinates are integers in logical-resolution pixels. Rectangles are
 * `x, y, w, h`, half-open. Lines are 1 px with inclusive endpoints. Ellipses
 * are given by their bounding box.
 *
 * These are `type` aliases, not `interface`s: an interface does not get an
 * implicit index signature, so it could not satisfy `PlainData`.
 * `DrawList.commands` and `GlyphAdvance` arrays are mutable arrays because
 * `DrawList` must be assignable to `PlainData` (whose arrays are mutable),
 * while `TickReport` arrays are readonly.
