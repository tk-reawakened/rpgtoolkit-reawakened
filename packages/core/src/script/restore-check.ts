/**
 * The program-aware half of a restored save's callable check (FUN-8; entry 18.6,
 * docs/spec/engine/rpgcode-language.md#keywords-and-structure).
 *
 * `restoreGameState` checks a snapshot's shape with no program to hand. A
 * callable names its definition by `def` only, and compiled programs are not
 * saved, so whether the game still has that definition, and how many names it
 * captures, can be answered only once the host has rebuilt its services. This
 * function answers it: it compiles the program of every frame, object record and
 * owner in `vm.defOwners`, then checks each callable against what it found. An
 * object record has no instruction position to resume, so a changed file-backed
 * class program is rebuilt from current source with its saved include list. Every
 * failure is a typed `ScriptError` whose message names the place in the save;
 * nothing is repaired, and a state with no named program compiles nothing.
