/**
 * Program references and compilation (AD-7; docs/spec/engine/rpgcode-language.md#open-questions follow-ups 5/6).
 *
 * `ProgramRef` is AD-7's shape plus the two lists a faithful rebuild needs
 * (docs/spec/engine/rpgcode-modules-and-objects.md#includes MOD-3 and
 * #redirects R-42): the files the program included at run time, and the
 * redirect table in force when it was compiled. Both are absent when empty, so
 * a ref without them is the shape that was saved before modules existed.
 * Compiled code is held outside state and rebuilt from the file or inline text
 * on restore, so `Program` is the compiled artefact and never enters
 * `GameState`.
 *
 * A file program is compiled together with every file it includes into one
 * flat `Program`: the main file's code comes first, then each included file's
 * code in the order the includes were applied. Only functions and classes of an
 * included file are reachable; its loose top-level code is in the array but no
 * jump enters it.
