/**
 * The VM state tree (AD-7, AD-26; docs/spec/engine/rpgcode-errors-and-threads.md#threads THR-2).
 *
 * `VmState` is AD-10's `vm` section: `threads`, `globals`, `objects`,
 * `redirects`, the effect log (`effects` and `effectSeq`, ticket 3.21), the
 * global-block status (`block`, R-32) and the request counter (`requestSeq`,
 * AD-5). `objects` is the one handle table of every object, dictionaries and legacy class instances alike (OOP-10, entries 19.3 and 19.5); `redirects` is the one run-wide redirect table
 * of entry 8 (R-42), ordered `[folded old, folded new]` pairs. `Thread` and `Frame` carry AD-7's minimum fields with the values
 * this entry fixes: `ThreadKind`/`ThreadOwner` are AD-26's, `source`/`target`
 * are THR-2's per-thread pair and `null` for a plain thread, and `errorHandler`
 * is `null` until entry 7. `Frame.operands` holds bound `Arg`s so a
 * by-reference reference survives to dispatch (docs/spec/engine/rpgcode-runtime.md#sem-3--comparison-and-conversion SEM-6).
 *
 * A thread's persistence is its kind: `persistent` survives a board change,
 * `board` dies with the board, `item` dies with its item (E-93), and a
 * finished thread stays registered until it is killed or its board or item
 * goes (THR-2; E-93).
 *
 * Everything here is `PlainData` (G1 rule 2): the `GameState` assertion in
 * `core/save` proves it at build time.
 *
 * docs/adr/0004; docs/spec/engine/rpgcode-errors-and-threads.md#threads (THR-2) (SEM-4/SEM-6).
