/**
 * Package start-up: the one run that establishes the layers a package registers
 * (MOD-4 lifecycle and point 3, PKG-5; entry 19.8;
 * docs/spec/engine/rpgcode-modules-and-objects.md#registerplugin-layers-entry-198).
 *
 * The owner rules that package layers are rebuilt at every start-up and are not
 * saved, so a host runs every package's start-up program, in manifest order, on a
 * fresh state before it uses the game: a new game does so on its own fresh state,
 * and a restore does so on a scratch fresh state and then loads the saved state,
 * keeping the layer table the start-up built. Start-up is deterministic and runs
 * on a fresh state both times, so it makes the same layer ids and the same closure
 * cells (`cell<n>`) both times, and the loaded state's cells and handles agree with
 * the rebuilt table.
 *
 * It runs the threads phase only, never the clock: a start-up program registers and
 * does not wait, so the clock does not move and a new game's state has no residue
 * of it but the cells, definition owners and variables the program made. The thread
 * is removed when it ends. A program that waits, or that has not finished after
 * `MAX_STARTUP_SLICES` slices of the step budget, stops the run with
 * `package.startup-unfinished`; it is a load-time failure, never catchable by a script.
