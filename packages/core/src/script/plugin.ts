/**
 * The plugin contract: `PluginDefinition`, the command handler and its result
 * (AD-8; ADR 0004 decisions 2 and 6).
 *
 * ADR 0004 decision 2 dogfoods the engine's own command library as a plugin, so
 * first-party packs, the TK2 compat layer and a game-shipped plugin all use one
 * shape: `PluginDefinition = { id, version, commands, decoders? }`. Decision 6
 * adds the composition — the host resolves manifest ids to definitions and
 * hands an ordered list to `script/registry.ts`, which layers them, later first.
 *
 * The handler is AD-8's functional contract,
 * `(view, args, next) -> { value, out?, effects?, wait? }`:
 *
 * - `view` is read-only: game state plus the injected `rng` and `clock` ports
 *   (decision U2). A command mutates no state, which is what makes a command
 *   replayable and the registry pure.
 * - `value` is the call's result (`null` when there is none). ADR 0004 writes
 *   the contract as `{ out, effects, wait? }`; the call's value is what the VM
 *   pushes for `x = command()`, and the tracer's `done` carried it before this
 *   entry. The plan's edge-case matrix is explicit that the empty result of a
 *   `next` with no layer below has "value `null`" beside no `out`, no `effects`
 *   and no `wait`.
 * - `out` carries by-reference outputs as `[index, Value]` pairs; the VM writes
 *   each back to the caller's variable (AD-8's `Arg.ref`, AD-14's `null`).
 * - `effects` are plain-data records the VM stamps with `{ seq, tick, thread,
 *   name, … }` and stores in the `vm` section's effect log; the section owners
 *   drain them and apply the change (AD-10; decision U1; entry 21).
 * - `wait` parks the calling thread; a blocking command's wait is `global`
 *   (R-32) and freezes every other script thread (AD-9).
 * - `request` with `then` asks the host for something (ADR 0004 decision 7).
 *   The VM parks the calling thread in a `request` wait, records the request
 *   (stamped with a `reqId`) in the effect log, and on the reply runs the named
 *   continuation with the reply prepended (`ok` as `1`/`0`, then the value)
 *   to `then.args`. `timeoutTicks` bounds the wait in ticks (AD-5).
 *
 * docs/adr/0004 (decisions 2 and 6); AD-8, AD-10.
