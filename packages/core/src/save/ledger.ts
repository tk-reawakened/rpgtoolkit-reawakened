/**
 * The game ledger: the validated, game-owned progress subset of savable state,
 * and its domain-separated hash
 * (docs/spec/formats/save-game.md#game-ledger-and-savable-continuation).
 *
 * A ledger is a derived view over one already migrated and validated
 * `GameState` candidate. It is never stored in `GameState`, never narrows an
 * ordinary save, and never replaces `hashGameState`: the normal snapshot keeps
 * the whole VM continuation (threads, waits, frames, locals, listeners), and
 * this projection keeps only what the game itself would have to remember for
 * progress to survive a recovery. A projection is plain data, pure, and
 * deterministically ordered; it records explicit absence (`LedgerPresence`) and
 * the engine's tagged form for `NaN`/`Infinity` rather than omitting a key or
 * emitting `undefined`.
 *
 * The boundary follows the accepted field mapping and its resolved engineering
 * decisions (2026-10-30):
 *
 * - `vm.globals` is the only persistent root. Reached objects, their members in
 *   `keys` order, closure cells, receivers and the reached definitions' owners
 *   are kept with live handles and cell ids, plus `vm.cellSeq` as the issued-id
 *   high-water mark, so no reference can be aliased. `events.emitters` entries
 *   whose object handle was reached are kept because a host object's owner
 *   binding lives there.
 * - Board-scope runtime tile edits are durable progress and enter the ledger;
 *   program-scope edits are continuation tied to a live owner thread and do not.
 *   The authored layers and images are rebuilt from the board asset, so only the
 *   mutable values and the durable edits are projected.
 * - Sprite identity, placement and game-modified settings enter the ledger;
 *   animation clocks, queues, movement, freeze time and thread links stay in the
 *   normal save.
 * - Saved actor equipment is projected as saved. Asset-aware equipment
 *   reconciliation is the candidate-acceptance gate of 8.23 (#797), not part of
 *   this projection or its hash: a changed asset must never reset saved values.
 *
 * The hash is FNV-1a 64-bit over the canonical tagged JSON of the versioned
 * envelope `{domain, version, ledger}`; it is an accidental-change detector for
 * the same domain, version and game identity, not authentication, a whole-save
 * checksum or the runtime replay hash.
