/**
 * The `events` phase: delivery of queued events (AD-26; EMIT-3, EMIT-10, EMIT-14;
 * docs/spec/engine/rpgcode-modules-and-objects.md#emit-14).
 *
 * The dispatcher is core-owned, not a script loop (discovery/step-budget-spike.md,
 * recommendation 2). It takes the oldest queued event, fixes the list of
 * listeners at that moment, and runs the listeners of the list in order, each on
 * a new `persistent` world-owned thread whose one statement calls the listener
 * with the event. Everything it needs between two steps is the `events` section
 * (the cursor), so a save taken between any two listeners restores and finishes
 * as the unsaved run does (G1).
 *
 * The listeners started in one phase share one `STEP_BUDGET`. A listener the
 * budget interrupts, or that waits, carries on in the following `threads` phases
 * like any thread and the dispatcher waits for it, so delivery order never
 * changes. No delivery happens while a blocking command waits (R-32).
