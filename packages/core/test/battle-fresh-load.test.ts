// A mid-battle save loaded into a brand-new engine (review of #702, finding 1): the saved pinned stance animations are
// restored already loaded, so the brand-new engine holds none of their picture files. It must ask the host for them,
// keep each animation's saved frame and origin tick, and never draw a frame whose picture it does not have.
// The save is the real thing: the engine's own `Save` request issued by a script during the fight.
//
// The same walk is the save/resume lifecycle evidence of docs/spec/engine/battle.md#bat-13: the run that continues
// without saving and the run loaded through the game's own `Load` path must reach the same ticks with the same state
// hash. The save holds no active audio, because active music deliberately restarts at position zero on load
// (docs/spec/engine/audio-media.md#audio-save-load) and the two runs would then diverge by contract.
// The last test is the reset half of that lifecycle: `reset()` during a live battle clears the battle and the script
// that was fighting it.
