/**
 * The audio page: the cue player and the PCM sink running together in a real browser (entry 9.5).
 *
 * The scenario is the spec's own three rules, each asserted as a fact rather than listened to:
 *
 * 1. **The autoplay lock is a delayed late start.** A looping music cue at tick 100 is played while locked, becomes
 *    ready, and the first gesture arrives at tick 145: the song joins at `(145 − 100) mod length`.
 * 2. **The 15-tick drop is measured from ready.** An effect whose voice becomes ready at lateness 14 starts at its
 *    caught-up position; one ready at lateness 15 is stopped, never played, and never ends.
 * 3. **The focus hold pauses without losing position.** `focus.lost` sends `pause`, `focus.gained` sends `resume`.
 *
 * The audio itself is asserted by pulling frames through the sink — the same call an `AudioContext` graph makes — and
 * measuring their energy, so the lane distinguishes silence from sound without a speaker. A real graph is attached too;
 * with the autoplay policy disabled for the lane, its analyser reads non-silent output for about the same duration the
 * sink reports, and both the energy and the elapsed seconds are asserted.
