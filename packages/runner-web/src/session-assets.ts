/**
 * The live session's asset tiers (docs/spec/engine/runners.md#prefetch, #load-modes): a synchronous in-memory cache the
 * renderer and the audio path read, in front of an asynchronous origin (the package source: memory, durable copy, then
 * network by validated range).
 *
 * Three callers fill the cache, and only one of them may stop the simulation:
 *
 * - `request` answers the engine's blocking `asset` request. A request the cache cannot answer *is* a stall: time is
 *   frozen while it waits, so it is recorded (key, whether a hint had named it, how long) and is observable through
 *   `state()` while it lasts.
 * - `hint` takes the core's prefetch plan. It schedules prioritised background reads (`now`, then `next`, then `always`)
 *   and never blocks, never throws and never changes anything a hash reads.
 * - `ensure` makes sure a set of keys is cached for the audio cue chain, which is its own ordered chain and not the
 *   simulation's.
 *
 * An unreachable origin is a thrown error from `request` (the page shows it as a load error); it is never turned into an
 * "asset missing" reply, because that would tell the engine a file does not exist when it only could not be reached.
