# Refactor sweep

## Scope

Remove duplication and address deferred review cleanup across the completed P0 asset editor stories without adding feature scope.

Inspect completed plans and review findings, remove obsolete scaffolding and duplication, preserve behavior and document any intentional deferral without absorbing unimplemented features.

## Acceptance and verification

The sweep accounts for prior review findings and preserves the asset editor and host conformance checks.

Use the shared document lifecycle and preserve same-version unknown data; exercise relevant failure/cancel, keyboard access and save/reopen paths rather than relying on preview alone. Follow `discovery/inception-proposal.md`, `docs/editor-features.md` and G2/G7; do not claim checks passed without executing them.

## Dependencies and decision gate

Prerequisites: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. None newly identified; check the linked proposal and actual providers before implementation.
