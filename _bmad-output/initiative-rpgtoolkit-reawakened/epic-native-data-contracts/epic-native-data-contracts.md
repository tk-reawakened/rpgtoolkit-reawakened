# Native data contracts: versioned, text-first documents, proved on the animation clip

## Description

The native game-data documents become explicit, versioned contracts. Each logical contract has its own semantic version, a path that is its ID, and a stamp at the top of every document. Plugin data lives in the document it belongs to, in one block per plugin under a single open key, `pluginData`, with its own version; the contract's own fields stay closed. The epic writes the rulings, builds the checker and the rename tool, and proves the whole path on one contract, the animation clip, before the actor family and scene contracts are specified. Jensen decided the rules on 2026-11-08, after research #1778 and #1799, and amended the plugin-data rules on 2026-11-09 (plugin blocks, qualified plugin ids, the two-rule model); ticket 27.1 records them, and ADR 0024 records the plugin side.

## Outcome

A creator or a tool author can open a native document, see which contract and version it follows, and edit it in a text editor or the editor with one-line diffs and comments kept. The owner can tell any two documents' contracts apart, and a broken ID or link is reported by name, not guessed.

## Requirements

Each line maps to CAP-20, the draft capability added on 2026-11-08 for this epic. Each also cites its source.

- E1: Versions are per contract, semver, and 1.0 is a promise once published in a release (ticket 27.1 Notes; #1800).
- E2: Every document carries a stamp (`contract`, `version`, optional `tags` and `metadata`); the path is the ID; plugin data lives in the owning document under `pluginData`, never in a document of its own (ticket 27.1 Notes; ADR 0023 decisions 7 and 12).
- E3: A checker reports stamp, ID and plugin-block errors by name and never repairs (ticket 27.1, criterion 6, as amended 2026-11-09).
- E4: The animation clip is the first contract; the 1:1 importer output stays an oracle and is never the native format (ticket 27.1, criterion 7).
- E5: A rename keeps every reference to a moved document valid; plugin data is inside documents, so there is no link to rewrite and a rename never edits a block (ticket 27.1, Notes).
- E6: The actor family and the board's placement-versus-definition split are specified as contracts, not copied from legacy file boundaries (`docs/findings/native-data-boundaries/README.md`).
- E7: The scene, tileset and asset-pack contracts are specified from the ADR 0019 draft and have readers and writers, so the scene editor of the first release can store what a board cannot: identities, placed packs, and collision and walk-behind kept with the art (ADR 0005, second amendment of 2026-11-11; ADR 0019, amendment of 2026-11-11).

## Done when

1. The ADR and the spec page from 27.1 are approved by Jensen and merged.
2. The checker, run over the authored fixtures, reports each ruled error class with the ruled message content and reports nothing on the clean fixture.
3. Legacy `.anm` files from the corpus import into native clip documents that decode to the same ordered frames and delays; a one-property edit changes one line and keeps every comment.
4. Renaming or moving a document leaves the checker clean on a fixture project with references and a document that carries plugin blocks, whose bytes stay unchanged.
5. The editor opens a native clip and saves a one-property change as a one-line diff.
6. The actor-family and scene contracts exist as approved pre-release specs, not published as 1.0.
7. The tileset and asset-pack contracts exist as approved pre-release specs with their registry rows; scene, tileset and asset-pack documents read, write and check; and a legacy board converts to a scene only when asked.

## Boundaries

This is the data-contract and document-tooling boundary. It does not include building editors for the actor family or scenes (the scene editor's save path, the build of a board from a scene and the collision controls are 12.15 to 12.17), runtime loading of those contracts, or migrating whole legacy games. It does not choose the layout contract, the schema technology or the YAML profile; #1799 leaves those open and they are decided inside the stories that need them. It makes no promise of a lossless migration of every legacy game, or that every game runs.

## Notes

- Decision: Jensen, 2026-11-08: the first round is not a straight 1:1 translation of every file. The item, NPC and enemy family and the board's placement-versus-definition split are redefined; clips, tile layers, skills and effects are translated with small corrections; the 1:1 importer output is a test oracle only.
- Decision: Jensen, 2026-11-08: the animation clip is the first contract; a thin slice through one contract comes before designing the others. Editors follow the contracts; the actor and scene editors wait for 27.7 and 27.8.
- Decision: Jensen, 2026-11-08: the other rulings (versions, stamp, IDs, sidecars, validator, rename tool) are recorded as dated Decision lines in ticket 27.1.
- Decision: Jensen, 2026-11-09: plugin data lives in the document it belongs to, in `pluginData` blocks, and not in documents of its own; the contract's own fields stay closed, plugin namespaces are open, and every writer preserves what it does not understand. This supersedes the 2026-11-08 sidecar ruling. The dated lines are in ticket 27.1's Notes; the plugin-side contract is ADR 0024.
- Decision: Jensen, 2026-11-08: prefer composition over inheritance for the actor family where we can. 27.7 chooses the parts and where composition cannot express something.
- Assumption: a contract stays pre-release (`1.0.0-pre.N`) until the owner promotes it at a release. Nothing here publishes a 1.0.
- Decision: Jensen, 2026-11-08: add CAP-20 as a draft capability for the native format. Its wording is the owner's to confirm in the spec.
- Open question: which package owns the path, ID and link rules, and which owns the file walk, given G2 (core touches no I/O). 27.2 settles it in its plan.
- Decision: Jensen, 2026-11-08: epics 12 to 14 do not gain a prerequisite on 27.6 for now; revisit when the editor proof exists.
- Parked: runtime loading, importer output and editor support for the actor-family and scene contracts. They are planned in a re-slice after 27.7 and 27.8 are approved.
- Waits on epic 2 because: the 1:1 importer oracle reads legacy files through the format registry and readers (27.4).
- Waits on epic 11 because: 27.6 needs the shared editor documents and platform-services. Early stories are independent.
- Decision: Jensen, 2026-11-11 (ADR 0005 second amendment; ADR 0019 amendment; merged in #1843): the scene, tileset and asset-pack formats come forward into the first release for the scene editor. Every other native contract stays deferred. Stories 27.11 to 27.14 are added and 27.8 is re-cut.
- Changed by that decision: the 2026-11-08 note that the scene editor waits for 27.7 and 27.8 now reads "waits for 27.8"; 27.8 no longer waits for 27.7 (its entry says what that costs); and the 2026-11-08 decision that epics 12 to 14 gain no prerequisite on 27.6 is lifted for 12.16 only.
- Still parked: runtime loading of any native contract, and importer output and editor support for the actor family.
- Decision: Jensen, 2026-11-11: a kind code is three or more letters (#1839, #1845), so `.tkrtile` and `.tkrpack` are valid extensions.
