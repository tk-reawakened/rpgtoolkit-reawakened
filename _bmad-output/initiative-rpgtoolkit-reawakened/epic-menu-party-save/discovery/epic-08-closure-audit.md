# Epic 8 closure audit

Audited at **`26740257`**. 19 of 25 children are CLOSED; six are open and own specific criteria, which are marked in
flight rather than unproven. No criterion is contradicted by merged evidence.

| # | Done when | Verdict | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Scripted play exercises item use, equip, remove, drop, buy, sell, party swap, inn restoration and a battle item use | **In flight (8.5 / #589)** | The shared inventory operation and its `stock_rpg` callers exist; the criterion is the ticket's own acceptance and 8.5 is **owner-gated by earlier instruction**, so its completion is not mine to claim. `actors.test.ts`/`battle-actions.test.ts` cover the battle item-use and stat limbs |
| 2 | The main, equipment, abilities and inventory screens open directly, are replaceable by RPGCode and preserve menu/input behaviour | **In flight (8.8 / #585)** | `stock/stock_menu` exists and the menu-provider seam is landed (`script-register-plugin.test.ts`, the `menuProviders` facet); the screen-by-screen acceptance belongs to 8.8 |
| 3 | Save then load mid-script restores every ruled section with identical hashes and later behaviour | **Proven for the engine's own path** | `battle-save-golden.test.ts`, the “full-engine save during battle resumes its parked thread” case, and `save-*.test.ts` suites; `pnpm golden`/`pnpm closing` unchanged. The *blob* (host) round trip is criterion 4 |
| 4 | Saving is refused on boards that forbid it; saves use `saveBlob`/`loadBlob`/`listBlobs` keyed by `GameId`; thread continuation follows the approved rule | **Proven** | `packages/core/test/save-*.test.ts` (board save-forbidden, `GameId` keying) and the blob request path in `engine.ts` (`saveBlob`/`loadBlob`), exercised by the `Save("slot")` cases in `battle-cues-engine.test.ts` and `battle-fresh-load.test.ts` |
| 5 | The interaction wrapper queues `dialogue.completed` only after normal completion; the `stock_rpg` bridge emits one actor-scoped `talked` with approved detail and nothing on interruption or failure | **Proven** | `packages/core/test/engine-edges.test.ts` (“engine beforeEnter rejects a waiting listener with a located diagnostic”) plus the dialogue/talked assertions in the stock-package suites; `stock/stock_rpg` is present |
| 6 | Menu, inventory, party and save built-ins register with the VM; every E-80–E-87 and E-123 behaviour has headless coverage | **In flight (8.8 / #585)** | The built-ins are in the catalogue (`catalogue:check`, `command-docs:check` green) and the inventory/party/save suites cover the engine side; the E-80…E-87 *screen* coverage is 8.8's acceptance |

## Findings

- **F-01 (owner-gated, already ticketed).** Six children remain: 8.5 / #589 (owner decision pending, excluded by
  instruction), 8.8 / #585 (screens), 8.10 / #593 (load validation), 8.13 / #594 (sweep), 8.14 / #595 (end-to-end
  acceptance), 8.17 / #777 (interruption-recovery checkpoints, `hitl`). No new ticket: each already exists and owns a
  criterion. The epic cannot close until they do.
  - Recommendation for the owner-gated 8.17: keep interruption recovery limited to *settled* points (pre-battle and
  post-battle ledger states), which is what the merged recovery work already does, and refuse a mid-battle candidate
  rather than inventing a battle-state serialization.
  - Rejected alternative: capture a mid-battle recovery candidate. It needs the battle section to be fully
  reconstructible from a ledger plus the audio section, which the engine does not promise, and would duplicate the
  ordinary save path's guarantees.
- Store: 19/19 closed children read `done`; the six open ones read their real state. No correction.

## Not probed

The four screen criteria (2 and 6) are the open ticket's acceptance, not an audit gap: the catalogue side is proven and
the screen behaviour is 8.8's deliverable.

## Re-audit at the refactor sweep (8.13 / #594)

At **`dc09ccd1`** plus the sweep's own commits. Every child of the epic is now `done` except 8.14 / #595, so the
"in flight" verdicts of the table above are settled: no criterion is contradicted, and each has merged headless coverage.

| # | Done when | Verdict now | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Scripted play exercises item use, equip, remove, drop, buy, sell, party swap, inn restoration and a battle item use through the shared inventory operation | **Proven** | `menu-state.test.ts` — "headless RPGCode Inn restores every active party member", "shop buy and sell actions commit item and gold events atomically", "party semantic actions preserve selection by actor identity and queue exact post-commit events", "headless RPGCode inventory commands request assets and apply item, equipment and gold operations"; `item-action-owner.test.ts` / `item-action-vm.test.ts` (use, equip, remove, refusal, interruption); `stock-menu.test.ts` (Drop, and the key-item drop refusal); `battle-item-stack-identity.test.ts` and `battle-actions.test.ts` (battle consumption through the same owner) |
| 2 | The main, equipment, abilities and inventory screens open directly, are replaceable by RPGCode and preserve menu/input behaviour | **Proven** | `stock-menu.test.ts` — the eight direct-entry cases (`mainmenu`, `itemmenu`, `equipmentmenu`, `abilitiesmenu`, `internalmenu(0/1/2/4)`) pinning each screen's drawn lines, plus pointer, gamepad, paging, frame-cursor and replay cases; `script-register-plugin.test.ts` (provider registration, replacement and rollback); `stock-packages.test.ts` (the four providers and the manifest's requests) |
| 3 | Save then load mid-script restores every ruled section with identical hashes and later behaviour | **Proven** | `battle-save-golden.test.ts`, `save-continuation.test.ts`, `save-load.test.ts`, `save-migration.test.ts`, `save-instruction-version.test.ts`, and the Save/Load picker cases in `stock-menu.test.ts` (real bytes, real restore, no diagnostic); `pnpm golden` and `pnpm closing` unchanged |
| 4 | Saving is refused on boards that forbid it; saves use `saveBlob`/`loadBlob`/`listBlobs` keyed by `GameId`; thread continuation follows the approved rule | **Proven** | `save-identity.test.ts` (GameId keying), `save-operation.test.ts` (board gate and the blob requests), `save-continuation.test.ts` (continuation), `stock-menu.test.ts` (the picker lists `saved/slot1.sav` and one `saveBlob`/`loadBlob` leaves) |
| 5 | The interaction wrapper queues `dialogue.completed` only after normal completion; the `stock_rpg` bridge emits one actor-scoped `talked` with approved detail and nothing on interruption or failure | **Proven** | `engine-edges.test.ts` (before-enter rejection path and the dialogue wait), `stock-rpg-bridge.test.ts` ("stock_rpg forwards completed dialogue to the speaker with exact details", "stock_rpg emits no talked event when dialogue is interrupted or lacks a source") |
| 6 | Menu, inventory, party and save built-ins register with the VM; every E-80–E-87 and E-123 behavior has headless coverage | **Proven** | The registration side is gate-enforced (`catalogue:check`, `command-docs:check`, and the 115 registered names carry no duplicate); the behaviour side is `stock-menu.test.ts` (65 cases, with each guard proved by removing it: the menu program's 17 from #585, plus the accessory flag, the `migrateEngine` call and the fractional-location guard from this sweep) plus `menu-state.test.ts`, `item-action-*.test.ts`, `save-*.test.ts` and the `stock_*` package suites |

Sweep-specific: one rule gained a single owner (the E-82 slot flag indices, F-01 in the plan) and one spec paragraph was
corrected to the shipped contract (F-02); no behaviour, draw list, state hash or baseline moved.

## Epic 8 end-to-end acceptance (8.14 / #595)

The acceptance branch adds a real-engine stock-menu play-through and a new
`golden/epic8/acceptance.json` with state and draw checkpoints. The fixture exercises item use,
equipment, ability information and execution, key-item refusal, custom menu graphics and UI sounds,
with a separate saving-disabled board case. Real-engine companion scenarios exercise CallShop
owner transactions and party swap, Inn, save bytes and instruction-version compatibility, the
stock dialogue bridge, and battle item consumption. These are additional acceptance evidence;
the separate unit and integration suites listed above remain relevant.

**Remaining blocker:** E-87's player-step counter is not covered by this acceptance suite.
A headless engine probe with input and movement phases moved the player one tile from
`(64, 64)` to `(96, 64)` while `party.steps` stayed `0`; see [#1231](https://github.com/tk-reawakened/rpgtoolkit-reawakened/issues/1231).
The CallShop scenario drives owner effects from a test phase hook, not a player-operated shop
screen. Consequently the earlier broad “proven” verdicts do not establish every behavior
requested by #595, and the epic acceptance remains blocked.
