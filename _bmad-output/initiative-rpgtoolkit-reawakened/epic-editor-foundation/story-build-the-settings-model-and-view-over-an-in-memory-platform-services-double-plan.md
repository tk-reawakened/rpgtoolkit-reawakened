title: "Build the settings model and view over an in-memory platform-services double"
ticket: 17
status: done
---

## Scope

Create the three packages the tracer needs and prove them with no host: `platform-services` (the interface, in its own package by owner ruling of 2026-11-10), `editor-model` and `editor-ui`. This story was cut out of 11.2 so the model and the view are proven before any host exists.

- `platform-services` holds the interface of [AD-20](../architecture-rpgtoolkit-reawakened/architecture-rpgtoolkit-reawakened.md) that the tracer uses, at least `fs` read, write and stat, and an in-memory double of it (the package's `./testing` entry, AD-22). It does not import Preact, `core` I/O or any host.
- `editor-model` holds a `.gam` document: the bytes read with `readMainFile`, edited through a serialisable command stack, written with `writeMainFile`, with document identity as in ADR 0022 D1 and the minor version and unknown residue the reader keeps preserved. It checks first that the writer re-emits the minor it was given for the supported versions (ADR 0022 D2.1) and refuses a read-write open otherwise.
- `editor-ui` mounts a Preact settings view with `mount(el, ctx) -> { dispose }` (ADR 0025 decision 4). The one tracer field is the game title (`gameTitle`, `docs/spec/formats/main-file.md#layout`); it shows dirty state and save errors.
- The edge list `tools/deps/edges.json` gains `platform-services` and its edges, and the spine's generated diagram is regenerated with `pnpm graph:write`. The spine's AD-20 wording is brought in line first, in its own docs commit (G7).

## Acceptance

The tests run against the in-memory double on real `.gam` bytes: edit the title, save, reopen and compare; a command is accepted or rejected whole; a failing save keeps the model dirty, keeps the edit visible and shows the error naming the document (ADR 0022 D3.1 and D3.3); disposing the view keeps the document and its undo stack. `editor-ui` and `editor-model` import no `host-*` package.

## Verification

Over the double, on real `.gam` bytes: editing the title, saving and reopening gives the edited title with every other byte, the file's minor version and its unknown residue preserved; a failing save keeps the model dirty, keeps the edit visible and shows the error naming the document (ADR 0022 D3.3); `editor-ui` imports no `host-*` package, proven by the dependency-graph check on the new packages.

## Decisions and prerequisites

Owner rulings, 2026-11-10: the `platform-services` interface is its own package, and the tracer field is the game title. The outside check for this high-risk story is 11.18: the same model and view code, unchanged, passes the shared behaviour test on two real hosts.

Prerequisites: 11.16 (toolchain), 2.9 (the main-file reader and writer, whose supported versions are checked here).

## Closure evidence

GitHub #1832 was closed by merged PR #1837. Rechecked at `699522d2` on 2026-11-13; this reconciles the stale draft status, not new implementation.

| Acceptance | Running evidence |
|---|---|
| Edit, save and reopen preserve the other bytes, minor and residue | `packages/editor-model/test/main-document.test.ts:46-69,82-103` |
| A command is accepted or rejected whole | `packages/editor-model/test/main-document.test.ts:198-218`; `packages/editor-ui/test/settings-view.test.ts:162-173` |
| Failed save keeps the edit, dirty state and named error | `packages/editor-model/test/main-document.test.ts:250-278`; `packages/editor-ui/test/settings-view.test.ts:131-160` |
| Disposing the view preserves the document and undo stack | `packages/editor-ui/test/settings-view.test.ts:196-249` |
| Editor packages do not import hosts | `tools/deps/test/graph.test.mjs:528-571`; `tools/editor-ui-toolchain/test/tsx-scopes.test.mjs:65-97` |

After `pnpm exec tsc -b packages/editor-ui`, the seven toolchain, graph, provenance, model and view test files listed in #1832's closure comment passed 163 tests in 15.36 seconds. This audit does not substitute for the later real-host proof.
