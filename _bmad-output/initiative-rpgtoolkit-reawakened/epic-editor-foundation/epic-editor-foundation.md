# Editor foundation: editor-ui, platform-services and two hosts

## Description

`editor-model` holds documents and command stacks, `editor-ui` hosts panels, the platform-services interface abstracts file access, test-run and export, and `host-vscode` and `host-web` run the same UI. The workspace, file tree, main-file editor and program editor with test-run work in both hosts.

## Outcome

Authors can open a legacy project in VS Code or in the browser and edit its settings and scripts; the CAP-15 and CAP-18 success checks, the same editor-ui opening and saving in both, are the signal.

## Done when

1. The same `editor-ui` build opens and saves a project through platform-services in VS Code (including a `vscode.dev` build) and in the PWA.
2. The workspace, file tree, folder-aware pickers with copy-in, and unsaved-change tracking work in both hosts.
3. The main-file editor reads and writes `.gam` so the result loads in the runner.
4. The program editor edits a program with the LSP and test-runs it against test fixtures in both hosts.
5. The dependency-graph check proves `editor-ui` imports no `host-*` package and neither host imports the other, and one host-conformance suite (undo by `editId`, save, revert, backup, external change) passes against both hosts.

## Boundaries

`editor-model`, `editor-ui` shell, `host-vscode`, `host-web`, platform-services (incl. `language.connect`), T-01 to T-14 and T-40 to T-41. Not asset editors (epic editor-assets-p0) and not the desktop shell (epic desktop-shell). Every feature lands in `editor-ui` first.

## Notes

- Open question: the platform-services interface surface; settled by the architecture spine.
- Assumption: epic editor-foundation owns CAP-18 until the desktop shell epic adds `host-desktop`. Confirm.
- Decision: epic set approved by the user, 2026-10-10.
- Waits on legacy-formats because: format readers.
- Waits on web-runner-packaging because: runner-web for preview and test-run.
- Waits on rpgcode-tooling because: the program editor's language tooling.
- Decision: envelope re-sliced against the architecture spine, 2026-10-10.
- Decision: Jensen, 2026-10-15: `docs/spec/` replaces `docs/format-spec.md` and `docs/engine-features.md` as the normative spec (ADR 0007, entry 1.13); the owner attests it is clean (extraction-log round 4). `docs/editor-features.md` (T-xx) is not replaced.
- Evidence (R-60): docs/spec/formats/rpgcode-program.md describes the editor's test run (`Prg\sys_test.prg` with its settings prefix, the engine run as `<main file> sys_test.prg`), and packaging-and-paths.md the new-project defaults; inputs for the test-run and new-project features.
- Handoff (from epic audio-synth exploration, 2026-10-18; detail in `epic-audio-synth/discovery/audio-exploration.md` §4, §6 and §7):
  - The project needs a Reawakened default-SoundFont setting, because `.gam` has no field (ties to research flow `08-project-file-by-convention`).
  - Test-run should report loading stalls with the asset that caused them, and warn on asset references the prefetch planner cannot predict (e.g. `send(boardVar$)`).
  - Audio preview in editors plays through the `synth` package with the project's SoundFont.
  - Packaging bundles the authored SoundFont, warns on unclear bank licences, and never redistributes the legacy MIDI pack.

- Handoff (owner request, 2026-10-24): Epic 22 (#624, `epic-rpgcode-grammar`) task 22.9 consumes this epic's shared document, program-editor and platform-services seams for highlighting/outlines. It waits for those foundations; this epic does not wait for Epic 22. Grammar absence must leave text editing and test-run usable.
