## Intent

Compare maintained pixel-editor libraries and a native implementation against all T-36 operations, G6 licensing including transitive dependencies, host embedding, keyboard access, offline operation and AD-19 document integration before any art dependency is installed.

## Scope and acceptance

Document evidence and rejected alternatives; no candidate is selected in advance, no GPL/MPL dependency or legacy source, and a failed reuse evaluation defaults to no third-party art library.

## Verification

A person reviews reproducible candidate, version, license and transitive evidence, working host integration findings, coverage and limitations, and approves either a qualifying choice or the in-house route.

## Dependencies and decisions

Prerequisites: 11.1. Apply the epic Notes, format specs, AD-18/19/20/22/29 and connected-authoring direction; T-36 maps to CAP-16. Preserve version and residue, use the existing shared model and browser, and route host access through platform-services. Where provider or host capability is unavailable, preserve data and report the limitation; do not simulate it.

A human-approved evidence decision is required before selecting or installing any art library.
