# P1 editor tools

## Description

Tile editor, tile grabber, tileset editor, enemy, special move, status effect and battle background editors, lighting and shading, the auto-tiler, undo and clipboard, export image and legacy upgrade wizards.

## Outcome

Authors get the full legacy toolset beyond P0; the CAP-16 success check is the signal.

## Done when

1. Each P1 tool opens, edits and saves its legacy format and the result loads in the runner and re-opens unchanged.
2. The auto-tiler picks tiles from the 8-neighbour rules and matches the variant order of community sample sets.
3. Export image writes the current view or the whole board without editor overlays.
4. The coordinate and legacy-board upgrades of T-30 and T-31 run in the editor with correct object movement.

## Boundaries

P1 tools of editor-features section 11. Not P0 or P2.

## Notes

- Audit (2026-10-31): this envelope has no `tickets.toml` breakdown, so it has no `tracker_id` and no GitHub parent issue, contrary to the initiative's mirror rule. Recorded, not fixed: a parent issue needs a real breakdown, and inventing entries to satisfy the rule was rejected. Filed as issue #882; `epic-editor-foundation` is the one to break down first because Epic 22's 22.9 waits on its seams. See `DISCOVERY-envelope-audit.md`.


- Open question: the auto-tiler variant ordering must be rebuilt from sample sets under G7; which sample sets? Entries wait on that answer.
- Decision: epic set approved by the user, 2026-10-10.
- Waits on editor-assets-p0 because: the board editor and shared tileset browser.
- Decision: envelope re-sliced against the architecture spine, 2026-10-10.
