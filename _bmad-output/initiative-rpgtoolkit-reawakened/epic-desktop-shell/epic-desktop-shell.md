# Standalone editor in a desktop shell

## Description

The desktop shell is **ruled** (epic web-runner-packaging, entry 9.1, D-1; text in that epic's ruling draft, and the
shell's ADR is 0013), so this epic does not re-run a three-way shell spike and does not choose an engine. It owns the
**editor application**: `host-desktop` as its **own package and its own application**, with its **own
`platform-services` instantiation**, the harness embedded for preview (the editor already runs the game it edits), its
chrome, and its **own signing, notarisation, updater and release cadence** — separate from the player's, because the two
audiences and their update churn differ. It **cites ADR 0013** and measures only what the ruling does not: how the
editor behaves in the ruled Electron shell — file I/O and watching, dialogs, file association and drag-and-drop of a
project onto the window — on macOS, Windows and Linux. It is not a mode of the player, and the player is not a stripped
editor.

## Outcome

Desktop users get the standalone editor with native file access; the CAP-18 success check for the desktop host is the signal.

## Done when

1. A written decision **cites ADR 0013** for the shell, states that the editor is its own application with its own update cadence rather than a mode of the player, and records the editor-specific measurements — platform-services file I/O and watch, dialogs, file association, drag-and-drop — from Windows, macOS and Linux.
2. `host-desktop` opens, edits and saves a project through platform-services.
3. The same `editor-ui` build runs in `host-desktop` with no host-specific editor features.

## Boundaries

The **editor application**: its own package (`host-desktop`), its own `platform-services` instantiation, the harness
embedded for preview, its chrome, and its own signing, notarisation, updater and release cadence. Not the shell choice,
which ADR 0013 rules and which epic web-runner-packaging's 9.1 records — this epic cites it and may not re-decide it —
and not the **player application**, which is epic web-runner-packaging's 9.10 and 9.11. Every feature lands in
`editor-ui` first.

## Notes

- Audit (2026-10-31): this envelope has no `tickets.toml` breakdown, so it has no `tracker_id` and no GitHub parent issue, contrary to the initiative's mirror rule. Recorded, not fixed: a parent issue needs a real breakdown, and inventing entries to satisfy the rule was rejected. Filed as issue #882; `epic-editor-foundation` is the one to break down first because Epic 22's 22.9 waits on its seams. See `DISCOVERY-envelope-audit.md`.


- Decision: ADR 0001 defers the shell choice to a spike; the choice is reversible through platform-services. (Superseded 2026-10-31 by the decision below: the shell is ruled, not spiked.)
- Decision: epic set approved by the user, 2026-10-10.
- Decision (2026-10-31): the shell is ruled elsewhere. Epic web-runner-packaging's 9.1 records the owner's ruling that
  the harness is separate from the game bundle, that there are **two desktop applications from one codebase plus the
  PWA** — a player and an editor — and that both desktop applications use the same ruled Electron shell with `app://`
  and no service worker; this epic cites that ruling and **cannot overrule it by accident**. The split is this epic's
  reason to exist: the editor is its own package and application, with its own platform-services instantiation, the
  harness embedded for preview, and its own update cadence. A divergence found here is raised as a new ADR that
  supersedes 0013, not implemented as a second shell.
- Waits on editor-assets-p0 because: the editor application cannot be measured without a board editor to edit, which is
  now the only reason — the shell comparison it once waited on is ruled and is not re-run.
- Decision: envelope re-sliced against the architecture spine, 2026-10-10.
