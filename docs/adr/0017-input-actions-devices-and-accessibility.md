## Summary

In plain terms:

1. **A game reacts to actions, not keys.** "Move up", "confirm", "cancel" and "open the menu" are the engine's vocabulary; a key, a mouse button and a controller stick are just ways of producing them.
2. **A designer can add their own.** "Fireball", "heal" and "backstab" are actions too: a game registers them with a label, an icon and a group, and they become as bindable, as remappable and as visible in options as the engine's own. A spell-and-skill game — the Diablo or WoW shape — can put dozens or hundreds of them on bars, grids and pages without the engine knowing what any of them mean.
3. **Every one of them can be changed by the player.** The game ships sensible defaults, and the options screen lets anybody bind any action to any key or controller control — with a keyboard, with a mouse or with a controller.
4. **Controllers work out of the box.** A standard-layout controller is on by default, its buttons map to the same actions as the keys, and the mapping is stored in the game file so a game can ship its own layout.
5. **Old scripts keep working unchanged.** `wait()`, `get()` and `clearBuffer()` still return exactly what Toolkit 3.1 returned, quirks included. The action layer is added beside the key queue, not on top of it.
6. **The engine's own screens are accessible.** Menu, dialogs, shop, save and options are all operable by keyboard alone, by mouse alone or by controller alone, with a visible focus indicator that meets WCAG 2.2 AA contrast — and the engine hands screen readers a plain-data description of what is on screen.

## Context

Today the engine has the beginnings of an action layer and no way to configure it. `core/input` holds a binding table from physical key code to one of seven movement actions, and it **drops any key that table does not name** — so a script parked at `wait()` never resumes on an unbound key, and a rebindable action never reaches gameplay at all ([#1091](https://github.com/tk-reawakened/rpgtoolkit-reawakened/issues/1091)). The menu, cursor maps, dialogs and battle screens do not use actions even where they exist: the menu reads the key queue, cursor maps poll keys, and each surface has its own hard-coded key set that Toolkit 3.1 fixed in place.

The controller is in the same position. The E-112 rule added a payload in which `buttons` is already an **action** bitmask (`up`, `down`, `confirm`…), computed by the host. That was the right call while the only question was "does a pad walk the player", and the wrong one as soon as a player wants their own layout: a host that has already collapsed buttons to actions cannot report *which physical button* was pressed, so nothing can be rebound. The `.gam` `useJoystick` byte has been stored and ignored since 3.1.

Finally, nothing in the specification describes what a player is allowed to change. Toolkit 3.1 fixed seven things in the main file (eight movement scan codes, an activation key, a menu key and 51 run-time keys) and hard-coded every other key in the engine and its plugins. A player who cannot use arrow keys had no path through the stock menu at all, and a single-character binding such as the demo's space bar has no disable switch — both of which WCAG 2.2 forbids ([2.1.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/keyboard.html), [2.1.4](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/character-key-shortcuts.html)).

The owner ruled the shape on 2026-11-01: every key and action configurable in the default ecosystem; a better solution than key polling for generic buttons, configured through the menu; controller support stored in the `.gam` and on by default; menus navigable by keyboard, controller or mouse; and WCAG taken seriously.

## Decision

1. **One action vocabulary, owned by `core`.** Gameplay, the menu, dialogs, cursor maps, the shop and the battle UI react to **actions**. The engine's set is fixed and may not be removed or renamed: `up`, `down`, `left`, `right`, `confirm`, `cancel`, `menu`. Actions are the only thing gameplay is allowed to read.
2. **The action space beyond that set belongs to the game.** A package or script registers an action as plain data — name in the reserved `game.*` namespace, plus label, icon, group, default controls and `locked`/`hidden` flags — and it is thereafter a first-class action: bindable, remappable through options, readable from a script, drawable on a bar or a grid ([ACT-2](../spec/engine/display-input-audio.md#act-2)). Identity is the name and nothing else, so changing a label or an icon never touches a save, and a game update that removes an action leaves the binding as inert data with one diagnostic rather than refusing the save. Registration is ordered by startup order, which makes the registry part of the state hash.
3. **The legacy key queue is unchanged.** Every key-down — including host auto-repeat — still appends its Toolkit 3.1 name (`ENTER`, `LEFT`, `" "`, the virtual-key fallback and the shifted-digit collisions) to the queue that `wait()`, `get()` and `clearBuffer()` consume. Actions are derived from the same event, beside the queue, and never remove a queue entry. [`wait()` semantics](../spec/engine/rpgcode-errors-and-threads.md) and the claim protocol are untouched.
4. **Bindings are data, in two layers.** The `.gam` carries the game's **default** bindings and whether controllers are enabled (on by default). The save carries the player's **overrides**. At boot the two are materialised into one effective table that lives in the `input` section, is snapshotted, restored and hashed like all other state. Nothing about a device or a layout is compiled in.
5. **Control ids are canonical strings, not device types.** A binding names a control as `key:<code>` (the DOM `KeyboardEvent.code` value, which is a physical position and therefore layout-independent), `pad:<n>` (index in the [W3C Standard Gamepad](https://w3c.github.io/gamepad/#remapping) layout, 0–16) or `pad:axis<0|1><-|+>`. `core` compares strings; runners translate their host's identifiers into them. The pointer is not bound to actions: it acts through hit-testing, so it works on any surface without configuration.
6. **The controller payload becomes physical.** The E-112 gamepad input carries a **physical** button bitmask on the standard layout and normalised axes; `core` applies the existing dead-zone (250) and resolves controls to actions through the binding table. The ruled default bindings reproduce the previous behaviour exactly (d-pad and stick → directions, A → confirm, B → cancel, Start → menu).
7. **Every engine surface navigates by all three devices.** One navigation cursor per surface, stored as data and drawn as a focus ring; keys and the controller move it through actions, the pointer moves it by hover and activates on **release** over the same item (WCAG 2.5.2). `cancel` always leaves the surface. The ruled Toolkit 3.1 navigation order per screen is preserved.
8. **Dense surfaces are a first-class shape.** A bar of at most ten slots during play, a grid (a spellbook) and the stock paged list share one cursor model, one pointer behaviour and one accessibility-tree shape, and a slot's cooldown is a `value` announced at its edges, never a per-frame update ([ACT-8](../spec/engine/display-input-audio.md#act-8)). Slot layout is the game's; the player's bindings never rearrange a bar.
9. **Author-drawn UI plugs into the same seam, it is not a second implementation.** A script declares a surface (`uiBegin`/`uiItem`/`uiEnd`) and the engine supplies the cursor, pointer hit-testing, focus ring, activation claiming and the tree subtree, so a hand-drawn title screen or spellbook is navigable and described exactly like the stock menu, without the author writing navigation or accessibility code ([A11Y-15](../spec/engine/accessibility.md#a11y-15)). A malformed surface is dropped for the frame with a located refusal — it never raises into gameplay — and a script that declares nothing keeps the automatic projection of decision 10.

10. **Accessibility is a contract, not an aspiration.** Engine-owned chrome and controls meet WCAG 2.2 AA: keyboard operability, visible and unobscured focus, contrast, pointer cancellation, target size, no unavoidable single-character shortcut, no engine-imposed timing, a reduce-motion preference and a flash limit. `core` emits a **plain-data accessibility tree** with each frame, and each runner bridges it to its platform's accessibility API. A game's own content is *best effort by construction*: the engine projects the primitives a script already draws into the tree without being asked (`mwin`, `text`, `prompt`, `msgbox`, cursor maps, buttons, canvases — [A11Y-14](../spec/engine/accessibility.md#a11y-14)), offers `a11yLabel`/`a11yRole`/`a11yAnnounce`/`a11yPref`/`contrastRatio` on top, and reports what it cannot describe. It cannot make an author follow best practice and never rewrites a game's own decisions; the author guidance is one published guide ([#1111](https://github.com/tk-reawakened/rpgtoolkit-reawakened/issues/1111)).
11. **A game may lock an action, and the engine reports the consequence.** A locked action is fixed at the game's mapping and is shown as fixed in options. A locked action bound only to single-character keys is reported as an accessibility violation (A11Y-4), because it cannot be satisfied by 2.1.4.

## Day-one rules

* `core` MUST NOT name a device in gameplay code; the only code that reads keys is the compatibility queue and the binding layer.
* The action registry MUST be ordered by startup order and never by map iteration; adding it to a running game MUST NOT change the state hash of a game that does not register anything.
* Binding resolution MUST index controls when the effective table changes and MUST NOT scan the registry per input event, so a 512-action game costs the same per tick as a 7-action one.
* A save MUST restore with a binding whose action is no longer registered, as inert data plus one diagnostic; refusing the save or dropping the binding is forbidden.
* The effective binding table MUST be part of the snapshot, and a restore MUST reproduce the same action edges from the same logged input events (G1, G3).
* A v2 input section MUST restore into the 3.1 default bindings; no save is refused because of this change.
* The `.gam` input block is append-only, tolerates unknown residue, and is ignored whole by a reader that does not know it — the same rule as the package-list and audio blocks.
* `wait()`, `get()`, `clearBuffer()` and the plugin `checkKey` path MUST keep their exact 3.1 return values; a golden that moves is a bug in the change, not a deliberate golden update.
* Every engine surface MUST be completable with keyboard only, pointer only and controller only; the headless harness proves each path with the same state hash.
* An accessibility tree node without a label MUST fail the harness, and the tree MUST NOT be part of the draw list or the existing goldens.
* Projection of script-drawn content MUST be on by default, MUST add no drawing command and MUST NOT change a pixel or a hash; an unlabelled node MUST be reported, never fatal to gameplay.
* A declared script surface MUST be able to express everything the stock menu can — order, focus, enabled state, pointer activation, cancellation — or it is not an insertion point, it is a toy. Its refusals MUST be diagnostics, never script errors.
* No new runtime dependency is required by any of this; the tree, the binding table and the action edges are plain data (G6).

## Consequences

* **What improves.** A game stops caring which device exists. A player who cannot use the arrow keys can play the stock menu. A controller works without configuration, and every surface behaves the same whether it is driven by keys, a stick or a mouse. Scripts gain an action surface when they want one and keep the old one when they do not.
* **Games now own half the action table.** A registration can be wrong — two actions on one control, a locked spell with no controller path, a hidden action a script still needs. Mitigated by registration-time validation, the options screen's duplicate refusal for the engine set, and the `a11y.character-shortcut` / `input.unknown-action` diagnostics rather than silent behaviour.
* **Options grows with the game.** A 300-action game would make a flat list unusable. Mitigated by `group` headings, paging on the stock item list's rule, and hiding script-only actions.
* **Two vocabularies to keep honest.** Actions and legacy key names now come from the same event, so they can drift. Mitigated by one event-application function and one test that asserts both halves — the queue entry and the claimed action — for the same input record.
* **The save and the format grow.** The input section moves to schema v3 and the main file grows a tagged block. Mitigated by the documented v2 migration and by the residue rule, which the package list and the audio block already use.
* **Pointer activation moves to release.** Muscle memory changes for anyone who has played the current build. Mitigated by a pressed visual state, and it is the only form that satisfies 2.5.2.
* **Target size versus 16-pixel tiles.** Legacy UI is drawn on a 16-pixel grid, which is below the 24-pixel minimum. Mitigated by nearest-target resolution, the large-cursor option and a scaled stock theme — the engine never redraws a legacy game's art to pass the rule.
* **The insertion point is an API a game must learn.** It is five calls and their state, and a game that ignores it falls back to projection. Mitigated by making the fallback good, by keeping the surface API to one open, one item add, one close and three reads, and by documenting the stock menu and the author path as the same model.
* **An author can ignore all of it.** A game that draws only pixels still ships, with an undescribed screen and a harness report. Accepted: the engine cannot police authorship. Mitigated by making the cheap path (ordinary `text` and `mwin`) described for free, and by publishing the guide as the one place the rules live.
* **The tree costs a frame's worth of data.** Mitigated by emitting it only when the host asks for it and keeping it out of the draw list, so no existing golden moves.

## Alternatives rejected

* **Keep the E-112 action bitmask.** It makes the controller work but makes it unbindable, which is the first thing a disabled player needs; withdrawn by the owner on 2026-11-01.
* **Remap in the host.** A host-side binding layer would put a device mapping outside the save, so a replay would depend on the machine, breaking G3 and the golden tests.
* **Rename the legacy queue to actions and translate on read.** It would satisfy the vocabulary on paper and break every 3.1 script that depends on `LEFT`, on the shifted-digit collisions or on `Wait()`'s queue-clearing behaviour, for no functional gain.
* **A per-screen navigation model (menu keys, battle keys, cursor-map polling).** Three behaviours are three places to get an accessibility bug and three sets of bindings nobody can discover; the ruled 3.1 order is preserved inside one cursor model instead.
* **Letting authors post raw tree nodes.** It would put ordering, focus, hit-testing and announcement policy in every game, and every game would get one of them wrong; the surface seam keeps those in `core` and asks the author only what the screen contains.
* **A fixed hotbar the engine owns.** Baking slot positions or a skill list into the engine would put game design in `core` and force every game into one shape; the slot list is game data and the engine only supplies the surface, the cursor and the tree.
* **Virtual-key fallback names for actions.** Actions are not characters; borrowing the legacy name space would make an action rebind look like a script change.

## Deferred

Haptics and adaptive triggers; analogue movement speed from a stick magnitude (the ruled dead-zone stays binary); multiplayer device assignment beyond device 0–3 merge; a screen-reader narration of *game content* (only chrome and controls are described); WCAG AAA; and a viewing-distance-dependent target-size calibration. None blocks the decision above.
