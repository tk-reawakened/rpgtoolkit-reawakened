# TK Reawakened Authoring Formats (`.tkrscn`, `.tkrtile`, `.tkrpack`)

This specification defines the normative structure of TK Reawakened's native YAML authoring documents ([ADR 0019](../../adr/0019-tkr-authoring-formats.md)).

These files are created and maintained in the authoring workspace (`editor-model` / `editor-ui`) and **compile/lower** deterministically into legacy runtime targets (`.brd`, `.tst`, `.iso`, `.tbm`, `.tan`) so the `@tk-reawakened/core` runtime engine can play them without requiring immediate changes to its runtime format decoders.

> **Status: draft, pre-release (proposed amendment, 2026-11-11, [#1839](https://github.com/tk-reawakened/rpgtoolkit-reawakened/issues/1839)).** These three formats follow [native-contracts.md](native-contracts.md). Brought into line here: the stamp (`contract` and `version` as the first two keys, in place of `schema: tkr-<kind>/1.0`) and the pre-release version. **Not yet in line, and to be settled when each becomes a contract page (story 27.8 for the scene):**
>
> * The contract names `scene`, `tileset` and `asset-pack` are placeholders.
> * The examples carry a document-level `id`, and a scene refers to a pack as `<pack id>:<asset id>`. Under native-contracts a document's identity is its path and references use it.
> * The top level is not yet stated as closed, and `pluginData` is not shown.
> * None of the three extensions is in [the registry](native-contracts.md#the-registry) until its contract page is written.
> * Which fields a `.brd` cannot hold, and so what the scene editor shows as unavailable on a `.brd` ([ADR 0019](../../adr/0019-tkr-authoring-formats.md), amendment).

## 1. Shared Conventions

1. **Format & Encoding:** Valid YAML 1.2 in UTF-8.
2. **Deterministic Serialization:**
   - Keys are serialized in the canonical schema order defined below.
   - Indentation is strictly 2 spaces; tabs are prohibited.
   - YAML anchors (`&`), aliases (`*`), and custom tags (`!`) are prohibited to guarantee straightforward JSON-equivalence and safe parsing.
3. **Identifiers:**
   - `id` values are URL/slug-friendly kebab-case strings (`^[a-z0-9]+(-[a-z0-9]+)*$`) unique within their document scope.
4. **Coordinate Units:**
   - All spatial points, rectangles, and dimensions use exact integers (logical pixels or tile grid steps). Floating-point coordinates are invalid.
   - Coordinate layouts use `2d`, `iso-stacked`, or `iso-rotated` matching [docs/spec/formats/board.md](board.md#coordinates).

## 2. Scene Document (`.tkrscn`)

A `.tkrscn` file is the source of truth for one board/scene. When saved, the editor builds the paired `.brd` file (plus auxiliary stamps/tiles if needed). A `.brd` that has no scene is still opened and saved directly; making a scene from it is an explicit conversion ([ADR 0019](../../adr/0019-tkr-authoring-formats.md), amendment of 2026-11-11).

## 3. Tile Recipe Document (`.tkrtile`)

A `.tkrtile` manages a cohesive tileset palette, including source sheets, non-destructive transformations, procedural 3-plane isometric blocks, and autotile transition sets.

```yaml

## 4. Scene Asset & Stamp Pack Document (`.tkrpack`)

A `.tkrpack` groups reusable art assets (props, architectural stamps, whole-room pre-rendered backdrops) along with their ground anchors, collision footprints, and walk-behind overhangs.

```yaml
contract: asset-pack
version: 1.0.0-pre.1
id: medieval-iso-kit
name: Medieval Isometric Props & Architecture
projection: iso-rotated
grid:
  tileWidth: 64
  tileHeight: 32

sources:
  props-atlas:
    file: Bitmap/medieval_props.png
    transparent: { mode: alpha }

assets:
  - id: stone-archway
    name: Stone Archway
    category: Architecture
    kind: stamp      # stamp | prop | backdrop
    anchor:
      x: 64
      y: 96
      snap: iso-diamond-center
    visuals:
      - source: props-atlas
        rect: [0, 0, 128, 112] # [x, y, w, h]
        layerOffset: 0
    vectors:
      - label: Left Pillar
        type: solid
        closed: true
        points:
          - [-48, -8]
          - [-32, 0]
          - [-16, -8]
          - [-32, -16]
      - label: Right Pillar
        type: solid
        closed: true
        points:
          - [16, 8]
          - [32, 16]
          - [48, 8]
          - [32, 0]
      - label: Walk-Under Lintel
        type: under
        attributes: 7 # covers background + lower layers + frame intersection
        closed: true
        points:
          - [-48, -80]
          - [48, -32]
          - [48, -16]
          - [-48, -64]

  - id: wooden-chest
    name: Wooden Chest
    category: Furniture
    kind: prop
    anchor:
      x: 16
      y: 28
      snap: bottom-center
    visuals:
      - source: props-atlas
        rect: [128, 0, 32, 32]
    vectors:
      - label: Chest Footprint
        type: solid
        closed: true
        points:
          - [-14, -10]
          - [14, -10]
          - [14, 0]
          - [-14, 0]
```

## 5. Lowering / Build Contract

When the editor saves a `.tkrscn` or builds for test-running:
1. **Tiles & LUT Generation:** Referenced tiles and generated autotile variants compile into local `.tst` / `.iso` files or into the `.brd` tile LUT ([docs/spec/formats/board.md](board.md#dimensions-and-tiles)).
2. **Placed Pack Expansion (`PlaceSceneAsset`):**
   - Each placed stamp or prop in `placedPacks` expands its `visuals` into either `WorldImage` entries in the board's image array or `WorldTile` cells on the corresponding layer.
   - Its relative `vectors` are translated by `(x, y)` and inserted into the board's vector array.
3. **Boundary Synthesis:** If `boundarySources` is active, the contour tracer executes and emits simplified `WorldVector` solid polylines (open outer loops, closed obstacle holes) and under polygons.
4. **Target Persistence:** The compiled output is saved as a legacy binary `.brd` (minor 4 vector layout) that runtime runners read without modification.
