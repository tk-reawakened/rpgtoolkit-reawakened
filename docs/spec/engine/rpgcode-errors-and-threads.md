# RPGCode: errors and threads

Two areas that share the same machinery: how a runtime failure is handled, and how a background program is scheduled and paused. The language itself is in [rpgcode-language.md](rpgcode-language.md), the values a failed call produces in [values, scope and conversion](rpgcode-runtime.md).

**How to read this page.** A rule is marked **legacy behaviour** when the extraction facts fix it, and **Reawakened rule** when this project deliberately departs from or adds to 3.1 ([ADR 0007](../../adr/0007-docs-spec-is-the-normative-specification.md), decision 2). Every departure says why.

Terms used below: a **frame** is one active function or method call; a **report** is the engine's error report (the file, a line and a message); the **unset value** is what a never-assigned variable or a failed call produces (the number 0, which reads as the empty string in string context); a **tick** is one fixed simulation update, 60 of them a second, and it runs a whole phase list; a **VM step** is one instruction the interpreter executes, so a tick holds many steps; a **thread** is one independent RPGCode execution with its own frames; a **wait** is the plain-data record a blocked thread holds until something wakes it.

## Error handling

Error handlers work inside functions only:

* `setErrorHandler(:label)`: on a runtime error, jump to the label.
* `setResumeNextHandler()`: ignore errors and continue with the next statement.
* `resumeNext()`: from inside a handler, continue after the failing statement.
* Legacy forms: `on error goto :label`, `on error resume next`.

Errors in nested calls are **not** caught by the caller's handler.

### ERR-1 — the handler, its label and `resumeNext`

* A handler can be set inside a function only. Setting one at program top level is itself an error; at top level an error is never caught, and it is reported unless messages are off. — legacy behaviour (R2-Q10).
* **Reawakened rule — the handler and its label (R-43).** The handler belongs to the function frame that set it and lasts until that frame returns. It stays active after it fires; it is cleared only when the error fires and its label cannot be found in that function, in which case the error is reported. The lifetime and the clearing rule are legacy behaviour (R2-Q10); the label check is ours: a handler's label must be in the function that set the handler, so it can never jump into another function. Legacy resolved labels across the whole loaded program by a first-match scan (see the note below); the rebuild keeps the one label rule already ruled for `branch`.
* A built-in that fails inside a frame is seen by that frame's handler. An error raised inside a called script function is seen only by that function's own handler; with none there it is reported and the callee continues, and it never reaches the caller's handler. — legacy behaviour (R2-Q10).
* `setResumeNextHandler()` swallows the error and continues at the next VM step, which may be in the middle of the failing statement, with the failed call contributing the unset value. It is not "the next statement". — legacy behaviour (R2-Q3).
* `resumeNext()` continues at the statement after the one that was executing when the error was raised. The return point is remembered per frame and used once, and it is part of the frame's handler state, so a snapshot taken while a handler is running restores it. Calling `resumeNext()` when no handler is currently handling an error, or outside a function, is itself an error. — legacy behaviour (R2-Q10); **Reawakened rule:** the return point stays inside the frame's single handler slot.
* When a labelled handler takes over, the failing statement's partial operand state is dropped. — legacy behaviour (R2-Q10); **Reawakened rule:** this is restated as plain state so a snapshot taken inside a handler restores identically.

**Note (unreconciled).** Legacy error labels were found to be program-wide, so a handler could jump into another function (R2-Q10); the label ruling above keeps labels inside the function. The difference between the legacy engine and this spec is recorded here rather than hidden.

### ERR-2 — which failures are errors, and which are catchable

* Without a handler, a runtime error is reported and the program continues with the next VM step; a runtime error never stops the program. — legacy behaviour (R2-Q11).
* Reports are suppressed while `debug(false)` has turned messages off (they are on by default). A failure that is not one of the interpreter's own kinds is always reported and is not affected by `debug`. — legacy behaviour (R2-Q11).
* **Reawakened rule:** every catchable runtime error is also handed to the host as a diagnostic carrying a code, the file, the line and a message, so a script error is both catchable by the script and visible to the harness.

| Failure | Outcome | Catchable |
|---|---|---|
| A call the resolver cannot match, or a script function called with the wrong number of arguments | Runtime error; the call's result is the unset value | Yes |
| A call through a value that is not a callable, a callable whose arity does not match the call, or a callable whose definition is in no compiled program | Runtime error; no value is produced | Yes |
| A built-in called with the wrong number of arguments, or with an invalid one | Runtime error naming the count it needs | Yes |
| An ordinary parameter given a value of the wrong type | Not an error: the value is converted by the coercion rules | — |
| A typed parameter given an object of the wrong class | Runtime error | Yes |
| An invalid object handle, a missing class, or an inaccessible member or method | Runtime error | Yes |
| An array index with no element | Not an error: arrays are sparse, and reading a missing element yields the unset value | — |
| Division by zero (`/`) | Not an error: infinity or NaN | — |
| Modulo by zero (`%`) | A catchable runtime error of the division-by-zero class; no value is produced | Yes |
| A built-in that fails (a missing file, item, player or board index) | Runtime error; a handful instead return the unset value silently | Yes, where raised |
| An obsolete built-in | Runtime error for most, a warning for a few; a handler treats both the same way | Yes |
| A load-time problem (a syntax error, an unmatched brace, a missing base class or constructor) | Reported once while loading; the partially built program still runs | No — no frame exists yet |
| A saved game whose function values are invalid on load (a damaged record, a missing closure cell, a function the game no longer defines, a capture count that disagrees with the definition) | The load is refused with a typed `restore.*` error naming the place in the save; no game starts from it | No — no frame exists yet |
| `kill()` on a system-controlled name (a `tk*` constant, an engine virtual variable, an actor stat alias) — code `kill.system-owned` | Runtime error, located; the value and the engine link are untouched | Yes |
| A write to a read-only system-controlled name (a virtual variable of the read-only set, `threads[i]`) — code `assign.read-only` | Runtime error, located; the value is unchanged and the link to the engine never breaks | Yes |

Every row above except the modulo row and the callable row is legacy behaviour (R2-Q11). The callable row is **Reawakened rule** (entry 18.4, 2026-10-18): the legacy engine had no callable values, so a call through one can only fail in the new ways this row names — a value that is not a callable, a callable's arity not matching the call, or a callable whose definition is in no compiled program. Each is a catchable runtime error with a located diagnostic, so a failed call is reported, replayable and never crashes the runner. The modulo row is **Reawakened rule R-44** (R3-Q3; facts-round-6, Remainder by zero and Q1): in 3.1, remainder by zero was an unhandled processor fault rather than a script error, and with the compiler and settings the released engine was built for, it did not reach script error handling and crashed the process (facts-round-6, Remainder by zero). The rebuild deliberately departs by raising a catchable runtime error of the division-by-zero class instead, so a failed script is reported, replayable and never crashes the runner. Because remainder converts both operands to 32-bit integers first (facts-round-6, Q1), any divisor in `(-1, 1)` (such as `0.5`, `-0.5` or `0`) truncates to 0 and raises this error. In addition, `-2147483648 % -1` (which also caused an unhandled processor fault on x86 in 3.1; facts-round-6, Q1 and Remainder by zero) normalises to `0` in our VM (plain data forbids `-0`). `bindingOf` (FUN-8; entry 18.5) adds two failures of existing classes, both catchable and located at the `bindingOf` call site: a name that nothing binds — no callable in the running scope's own symbol, no built-in, script function or plugin command — is the same class as the first row (`unknown.command`, a call the resolver cannot match), and an argument that is not a string is an invalid built-in argument (the third row, `builtin.bad-arg`).

**The two system-name rows (entry 19.1, 2026-10-19; Reawakened rule, OWNER).** These two rows, `kill.system-owned` and `assign.read-only`, are Reawakened rules and are not covered by the "legacy behaviour" sentence above: 3.1 had neither error (it let the script sever the engine link instead, see VIRT-1). *What they mean for a game author:* the engine's own names (`music`, `HP!`, `tkDIR_N` and the rest) belong to the engine. You cannot delete one and you cannot overwrite a read-only one; either attempt is a runtime error your handler can catch, and the name keeps its value. *Precisely:* `kill.system-owned` and `assign.read-only` are catchable runtime errors with a located diagnostic like any row above; the rules for which names and which writes are in [`kill`, KILL-1](rpgcode-language.md#kill-1) and [VIRT-1](rpgcode-language.md#virt-1), with the evidence and the rejected alternatives (3.1's broken link, a silent no-op). A write to a writable system-controlled name (the ambient light, an actor stat alias) is not an error: it writes through. *Evidence:* the owner's decision of 2026-10-19 (epic-rpgcode-platform Notes). <!-- OWNER: ERR-2 — Jensen, 2026-10-19: `kill()` on a system-controlled name is a catchable runtime error `kill.system-owned`; a write to a read-only system-controlled name is `assign.read-only`; both are rows of this table. -->

**The game `error` event (entry 19.1; Reawakened rule, OWNER).** Every runtime error above, whether or not a handler caught it, is also emitted on the game emitter as the non-cancelable event `error` with `detail` `{ code, message, file, line, handled }`, like `window.onerror`. It is a notification in addition to the handling above: it does not catch, replace or suppress the script's handler, and it fires whether or not a handler caught the error (`handled` says which). The event model, the queueing and the details are in [EMIT-9](rpgcode-modules-and-objects.md#emit-1); entry 19.12 builds it. This is the same diagnostic the host already receives (the rule above this table), now also visible to scripts.

**What `handled` means and when the event fires (entry 19.12).** `handled` is `1` when the failing frame's handler took the error (a label handler whose label was found, or the resume-next handler) and `0` otherwise; the event is queued for every failure the host receives as a diagnostic, `debug(false)` included, and never for a load-time problem or a refused load, where no frame exists. An error raised by the thread running a listener of the `error` event is not emitted again. The rules are [EMIT-22](rpgcode-modules-and-objects.md#emit-22).

## Threads

### THR-1 — the sleep, its unit and wake order

* `threadSleep(id, seconds)` takes a number of real seconds, and a fraction is allowed. A duration of exactly `0` (or `-0`, which the rebuild normalises to `0`) means sleep until `threadWake`. `threadSleepRemaining` reports the time left in seconds, or `0` while the thread sleeps indefinitely or is not sleeping. — legacy behaviour (R2-Q23).
* **Reawakened rule — the tick formula.** A positive duration is converted to whole ticks with exactly this formula and no other rounding:

  `ticks = max(1, floor(seconds * 60 + 0.5))`

  using a double multiply and `Math.floor`/`Math.max` only. *Reason:* the legacy engine truncated seconds to whole milliseconds and woke on a wall clock (R2-Q23), which cannot be replayed. A stated formula removes the "halfway" ambiguity (the decimal half is not the binary half), keeps the error under half a tick, and stops a small positive sleep from aliasing the indefinite sleep.
* A negative or non-finite duration, or one whose tick count would exceed 2^53 − 1, is a catchable runtime error; a tick must stay an exact integer. — **Reawakened rule:** legacy left a negative duration undefined (it became a huge wait). No sleep is entered, and the thread continues with the next VM step unless a handler runs.
* **Reawakened rule — the end tick.** The wait stores the absolute end tick `T + ticks`, where `T` is the tick in progress when the call runs. A one-tick sleep therefore ends in the next tick: the wait phase of tick `T + 1` sees `now >= end` and wakes the thread.
* **Reawakened rule — remaining time.** `threadSleepRemaining` returns `(end − now) / 60`, unrounded, and `0` for an indefinite or not-sleeping thread.
* **Reawakened rule — wake order.** When several threads are due to wake on the same tick they resume in ascending thread id. Legacy stepped threads in an unspecified order (a pointer-ordered set); ascending id is deterministic and matches the wait phase, which polls waiting threads in ascending id.

### THR-2 — the `source` and `target` handles

* Legacy kept `source` and `target` as two engine-wide slots shared by everything: the code that started an entity event (an item's thread, an equip, a sprite program, a fight) set them and restored them afterwards, a plain thread left them alone, and `tellThread` code saw whatever the caller had left there. — legacy behaviour (R2-Q24).
* **Reawakened rule — one pair per thread, in state.** Each thread carries its own `source` and `target`, part of the snapshot, so a thread restored mid-run sees the same context.
  * An entity event (an item's own thread, an equip or a remove, a sprite-triggered program, a fight) sets the pair on the thread that runs that event's program, for the program's duration, and the previous values are restored when it ends. A plain thread has `null` for both.
  * The `"source"` and `"target"` special handles read those slots; `sourceHandle()` and `targetHandle()` return `0` when a slot is `null`.
  * `run()` does not change the pair. — legacy behaviour (R2-Q24).
  * Reason this departs from legacy: the shared slots make one thread's context depend on unrelated events and cannot be replayed; per-thread slots are deterministic.
  * **Legacy (R12) — which starters actually restore the slots.** Clean-room [round 12](../../provenance/facts-round-12.md) (reviewed and fact-checked against `2f986f3e` and `9191b919`) refines the first bullet: in 3.1, only an equip or remove program (which sets the target only and leaves the source alone) and a board-item activation restore afterwards; the battle uses (enemy custom AI, special move, item in battle, status program) and the menu uses leave the last values set; and the level-up, enemy win, enemy run, game-over, start-up, board-enter, key and link programs set nothing and see whatever an earlier program or battle left. See the use table under [`callProgram`](rpgcode-functions.md#reawakened-callprogram).
  * **Reawakened rule — nested program calls and the use table (Proposed, pending owner review).** The engine and script starters in that table run through [`callProgram`](rpgcode-functions.md#reawakened-callprogram), which sets the pair on the calling thread for the call and **restores it when the call ends** (a deliberate departure from the battle and menu rows of R12), inherits the caller's pair when none is supplied (and for an equip or remove program sets the target to the wearer and inherits the source), and passes `null`/`null` for the programs that legacy leaves unset (a deliberate departure from R12's stale values). *Rejected:* keeping the legacy "last values stay set" rule for battle and menu programs, and keeping stale values for outcome and start-up programs, for the same replay reason as above.
* **Reawakened rule — `tellThread` is queued, not immediate.** `tellThread(id, code)` stores the injected code on the target thread, which runs it at its next turn in the threads phase, spending the target thread's own budget and seeing the target thread's `source` and `target`; the caller's step is not interrupted. Legacy ran the code at once, inside the caller's moment, with the caller's slots; queuing keeps a step's outcome independent of another thread's state, which a deterministic replay requires.

<a id="thr-3"></a>
### THR-3 — what a "step" is, and the preemption budget

* **Reawakened rule — a step is one VM instruction.** In this spec a `step` is one instruction the VM executes, and it is not the same as a `tick`, which is one fixed simulation update (the whole phase list). A snapshot may be taken between any two steps, and a test that compares "the same state hash after N steps" counts VM steps, not ticks.
* **Reawakened rule — the budget (R-33).** A thread's preemption budget counts the VM steps that thread runs in one tick. A thread that reaches the budget without yielding keeps its state and continues at the next tick, so being preempted is not an error. *Legacy fact:* 3.1 set the per-tick instruction budget to `(fps − 60) × 10`, with a floor of 10, and the arithmetic wrapped for a frame rate below 60. At our fixed 60 Hz tick that formula gives 0, floored to 10, so the number is not inherited from it. The rebuild's budget is a fixed number, never derived from a frame rate: the VM defaults to 1000 steps (the value its stress tests exercise: a never-yielding loop is preempted at exactly that many steps a tick and resumes next tick), and a caller may pass a smaller budget to the threads phase. The movement entry that shares the budget may retune the default against the demo. The unsigned wrap is a quirk and is not reproduced.
* **Reawakened rule — waiting and the budget.** A waiting thread runs no VM steps and so uses no budget. The wait phase polls waiting threads in ascending id before the threads phase, so a thread that wakes in a tick runs in that same tick and spends that tick's budget.

### Blocking commands (R-32)

**Reawakened rule — execution observation.** A host can count instructions and
inspect successful call resolutions without changing a game's execution. Optional
VM service observers run synchronously in the step machine, outside saved state:
one step notification per attempted instruction, one call notification per
successful resolution, and separate native-handler accounting for layers actually
entered through `next`. Payloads are detached immutable data; observer failures
do not become script failures. Unobserved execution allocates no observation
payload. Tracing must preserve every state hash and golden; a difference is an
instrumentation bug. See [ADR 0010](../../adr/0010-script-execution-observers.md).

* A blocking command inside any program stops **all** script execution, movement and frame updates until it finishes, because everything runs on the engine's single main loop. *Legacy fact:* In 3.1, `Delay` froze the window entirely with no repaint at all; only `Wait` and `Prompt` kept the window responsive while waiting for input (round 5, Q4; facts-round-6, Q9). In Reawakened, our host renderer always repaints (no window freeze), but all script execution, movement and frame updates remain stopped until the blocking command completes, matching 3.1's execution behaviour without freezing the host window (no behaviour change). Threads do not pump window messages, so a thread that needs to pause without freezing the game must use `threadSleep` instead.

**Reawakened rule — a deliberate departure from our own earlier design.** This project's earlier per-thread wait model — a blocking command blocking only the thread that ran it, while other threads and the world kept running — is **withdrawn**. A blocking command now waits the whole game, always, matching 3.1. There is no per-project setting to restore the old behaviour; a setting for new games (with imported games defaulting to off) is a possible future enhancement, and nothing is built or reserved for it. *Reason:* the legacy freeze is what existing games were written against, and a save cannot contain a half-pumped main loop. (Owner ruling U1, 2026-10-15.) The VM's wait registry and the wait kinds it yields (`input.key`, `sleep`, `menu.screen`, `movement`, …) are unchanged; what changes is that a blocked program blocks the world, not just itself.

## Waits

<a id="wait-view-and-key-claims"></a>
**Reawakened rule (OWNER; WaitView and key claims).** `WaitView` is a read-only view of `input` and `ui` state. An `input.key` waiter stores the input sequence at park; polling returns the lowest unclaimed key at or after that sequence. The engine claims the key in `engine`, making the claim visible to the rest of the same waits phase without writing it to `input` or `vm`; the input owner prunes claimed keys. `get` and `clearBuffer` use this same protocol. Thus two waiters deterministically consume two keys in sequence, and a key is never delivered twice.
