# Runners

What a runner is, what it must do, and what it is allowed to decide. This page is the normative contract between the
core and any runner — browser, desktop application, mobile wrapper or the headless harness — and it is the page a
non-TypeScript runner is written against.

It exists because the owner ruled on 2026-10-31 that **the runners in any language share one shape**: the behaviour is
normative prose, the boundary is plain data, and a conformance kit decides who complies. The TypeScript packages are
one binding of this page, never the contract itself.

**Status.** This page is normative from its landing date. The runner packages exist in `packages/` today: `runner-harness` (the conformance harness and its schema) and `runner-headless` (the headless golden lane) landed first, and epic `web-runner-packaging` has since built `runner-web`, `runner-desktop` and `runner-mobile`; the table at [Implementation status](#implementation-status) names which entry delivers each section. Nothing here describes a feature that no entry will build; where a section names a file, that file is that entry's destination.

**What this page does not restate.** The engine API is AD-1; the draw
command union is AD-3; the event union is AD-14; the request union is AD-17; audio cues are AD-16 and
[audio-media.md#runner-audio-protocol](audio-media.md#runner-audio-protocol). Those pages own the record shapes. This
page owns the runner's obligations, the latitude it has, and the checks that prove it.

<a id="boundary"></a>
## The boundary

A runner is everything outside `core` that makes a game visible and audible. It owns four jobs and no others:

| Job | It receives | It must not |
|---|---|---|
| Replay draw lists | a `DrawList` per frame (AD-3) | own the game loop, hold game state, run game logic, or call into `core` except through the engine API (G4) |
| Play audio | `AudioCue` records and the audio protocol's messages (AD-16, [audio-media.md#runner-audio-protocol](audio-media.md#runner-audio-protocol)) | change a cue's meaning, invent or drop an `audio.ended` a cue owes, or send anything back except an AD-14 input |
| Deliver input | the host's own events | decide a tick, reorder a tick's events, or write the input log (AD-14: the core writes it) |
| Service requests | `TickReport.requests` (AD-5, AD-17) | return bytes any other way, cache a reply's *content* as state, or block the simulation itself |

The core never waits on a runner except through a blocking request, never reads anything back except an AD-14 input, and
never learns a runner's name. Everything a runner sends the core is an input `{ tick, event }`; everything the core
sends a runner is plain data — structured-cloneable, fixed keys, absent values `null` (AD-1, AD-14).

<a id="runner-may-decide"></a>
## What a runner may decide, and what it may not

**May:** the output API (WebGL2, Canvas2D, a native surface), buffer sizes and threading, which work runs in a worker,
which sources and banks are installed, presentation scaling and letterboxing (AD-33), where a save physically lives
(AD-17), and the player-facing preferences of [audio-media.md#soundfont-layers](audio-media.md#soundfont-layers).

**May not:** change the meaning of a record, drop or invent a reply the core expects (AD-5, AD-14), feed device state
into the simulation, depend on how ticks were batched (AD-1), or keep anything caches hold observable: discarding a
cache at any moment must change no pixel, no sound and no hash (G4 rule 3).

<a id="draw-list"></a>
## Draw-list replay and the presented frame

A runner replays the `DrawList` of the current tick and nothing more (G4). Two obligations follow.

**Scaling is presentation.** The core emits a draw list for the logical viewport; a runner maps it to the physical
display in one of the two modes AD-33 allows — integer-scaled pixel-perfect letterbox, or responsive expand-viewport —
chosen by the player, never by the game state. `alpha` is presentation-only and is excluded from state and draw hashes,
so a runner may interpolate between ticks and may not let interpolation reach anything the core reads.

**Desktop fit — Approved ruling (owner: Jensen, 2026-11-02).** Show the whole game frame, centred on a black
surround, even when the window or display is too small for its original size. Enlarge it in whole-number steps when
possible, keeping its proportions; the only non-integer case is shrinking a frame that cannot fit at 1×.

For logical dimensions `W × H` and available content dimensions `Cw × Ch`, let
`r = min(Cw / W, Ch / H)`. Use `floor(r)` when `r >= 1`, otherwise use `r` without integer rounding. Present
the frame at `W × scale` by `H × scale`, centred in the content area; any fractional margins are shared equally.
Recompute on content-area resize, including changes imposed by display constraints. Map pointer coordinates through
the same presented rectangle back to logical coordinates. This transformation is presentation only and changes
neither simulation state nor its hash.

**Textures come from the core, not from the runner's own decoder.** A runner fetches asset bytes through an AD-5
request; the core decodes them (AD-28) and the runner pulls pixels it needs from surfaces with
`engine.surfacePixels(id, rev)` (AD-27). A runner may keep a texture, glyph-atlas or tile cache keyed by `(id, rev)`,
because `rev` increments on every mutation and an unknown or stale `rev` returns `null`; it must be able to refill at
any time, and a test that flushes every cache every frame must produce identical pixels.

<a id="surface-read-and-state-hash"></a>
## Surface reads, presentation and game state

**Approved ruling (owner: Jensen, 2026-11-02).** Showing a frame must not change the game merely because a runner
looks at its pixels. The presented screen surface is a derived presentation cache, not game progress. It is excluded
from the state hash and is rebuilt deterministically on restore before any script reads it. This combines the
2026-11-01 option C ruling with the read-only host-accessor rule; it replaces the earlier wording that an owner
decision on that rule was required. The core implements it as described below (issue #1048).

Owner ruling (Jensen, 2026-11-01), approved option C, verbatim:
> the presented screen surface is a derived cache excluded from the hash, rebuilt deterministically on restore before any script read; script-owned canvases (`cnvX`) remain hashed.

Follow-up approved ruling (owner: Jensen, 2026-11-02), verbatim:
> RPGCode script-owned canvases (cnvX) are application store, treated like global variables — they STAY in the state hash, and drawing to them legitimately changes it. Only the presented screen surface (the derived presentation cache) is excluded. Hash-significant: script variables/globals, cnvX canvases, game-loop globals needed to store coordinates. Hash-neutral: drawing to / reading / refreshing the presented screen surface and any host surfacePixels poll.

`engine.surfacePixels(id, rev)` **MUST** be observationally read-only. It returns an owned copy of the requested
stored revision, or `null` if the id or revision is unavailable. It **MUST NOT** mutate `GameState`, surface revisions,
the state hash or save data, or change future diagnostics, regardless of host polling or cache-flush cadence.
Refreshing the screen for script-visible `getpixel`, `canvasgetscreen` or `savescreen` is a deterministic core
operation, separate from host presentation reads. A runner cannot trigger that operation by polling.

**Enforcement by type/API rather than convention (answering the open question on #1048):**
Host accessor purity is guaranteed structurally rather than by trusting runners or developers to follow convention:
1. **Type signature:** `surfacePixels(id: SurfaceId, rev: number): SurfacePixels | null` is typed as a read-only query taking primitive values and returning `{ readonly w: number, readonly h: number, readonly rgba: Bytes } | null`. It accepts no callbacks, configuration flags, or mutable contexts.
2. **API separation:** The presentation query is separated entirely from the screen composition pipeline. `surfacePixels` resolves the stored entry for `id`, compares its `rev` and returns `null` on any mismatch; it never invokes the core's frame rebuild. Only a deterministic core operation — the end of `advance`, a script screen read, or a restore — rebuilds surface 0.
3. **Detached buffer ownership:** The returned `rgba` byte buffer is a newly allocated copy (`new Uint8Array(entry.bitmap.data)`), so runners can retain, wrap, or mutate it without corrupting the engine's internal state.

**Two surfaces, not one.** A script that draws and names no canvas draws to the **script-screen layer**, a persistent
surface with the reserved id `-1`. The id is fixed, never taken from the monotonic counter, so the first draw to the
screen moves neither the counter nor any canvas handle, and a script cannot name the layer (handles are never
negative). The layer is created on first use at the frame's size. While an outermost program runs it is composited
between the board and the render-now overlay into surface 0, the **presented frame**; outside a program it is retained
but not composed. Drawing to the layer never overwrites the board, and rebuilding the frame never discards what the script drew.
Both surfaces are saved; neither is hashed.

**When the core rebuilds the frame.** The core rebuilds surface 0 from game state alone, and only at three points: at
the end of every `advance` call; immediately before a script reads the screen (`getpixel` on the screen,
`canvasgetscreen`, `savescreen`, and a canvas draw whose source is the screen); and when a saved game is restored,
before any script runs. A rebuild is skipped when the frame it would render is the one already rebuilt — the same
draw-list size and commands (the tick stamp is not part of the comparison) and no asset has arrived since — and a
restore always rebuilds. The frame's pixels and revision therefore depend on the game and on how `advance` calls were
batched, never on how often a host read them; its revision and bytes may differ between batchings, which is harmless
because surface 0 is excluded from the state hash. A state edit made between `advance` calls shows in the frame at the
next `advance` or script read, never on a host read.

**What leaves the hash and what stays:**
The hash includes the application store: script variables and globals, script-owned canvases (`cnvX`), and game-loop
globals needed to store coordinates. Drawing to `cnvX` changes the hash when it changes that store, just as changing a
global variable does. Drawing to, reading or refreshing the screen — the script-screen layer and the presented frame
alike — is hash-neutral. A script that needs screen content later captures it into a canvas or a numbered slot, and
those are store.
Moving a player changes character state and therefore should change the hash; viewing the screen more often must not.
See [the surface hash projection](../formats/save-game.md#state-hash-surface-projection).
Jensen's principle is: “Drawing to the surfaces shouldn't cause a hash change. The only reason the hash should change
is if the application store changed, e.g. rpgcode surface plus some of the game-loop globals needed to store
coordinates.”
Conformance compares the same game and inputs with no host reads, repeated reads, cache-flush reads and stale-revision
reads: per-tick hashes, save data, revisions and future diagnostics must agree. It checks that a `cnvX` draw that
changes the store moves the hash, while drawing to, reading or refreshing the presented screen and host polling do not.
It also checks deterministic rebuild before script reads and preserves script-visible screen capture behavior.

<a id="webgl2-agreement"></a>
## The WebGL2 agreement bound

The WebGL2 replayer and the reference rasteriser in `core/raster` are compared per draw command, on the conformance
vectors and on every gating golden scene:

- **exactly** on every decision the CPU pipeline makes discretely — colour-key exclusion, tint saturation, and the
  choice of blend;
- **within one unit per channel** on the arithmetic a GPU may round differently, which is the `translucent` and
  `additive` blend of AD-3's pixel pipeline, with the worst per-channel difference reported per vector.

**What is drawn today.** Entry 4 replays all eight commands of AD-3's union — `fill`, `rect`, `line`, `ellipse`, `blit`
(with the `.iso` projection and persistent surfaces), `text`, `pushTarget` and `popTarget` — at the draw list's logical
resolution, with AD-33's two presentation modes as viewport geometry. The pixel sets a GPU cannot derive on its own come
from `core/raster`'s leaves rather than from a second implementation: `linePixels`, `rectOutlinePixels`,
`ellipsePixels`, `isoSourceOffset` and `textInk` (which owns the legacy cell scaling, the italic shear, bold's second ink
and the TrueType outline's coverage), plus `DEFAULT_FONT_ASSET` for AD-15's substitution of a family the game does not
ship. A tiled blit uploads only the tile it names, because a `.tst` strip of a large board can exceed
`MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE` and an incomplete texture samples as black.

A renderer that cannot draw a command **MUST** count it as deferred and report a diagnostic, never draw an approximate
pixel in its place. A frame that reports a deferred command is a partial frame, not a pass; the browser lane today
reports none on any gating ledger row or committed vector.

This bound never widens a PNG golden: `independent-reference` and `regression-baseline` rows stay exact
([parity-checklist.md#golden-image-oracle](parity-checklist.md#golden-image-oracle)), and a `legacy-screenshot` row stays
report-only. A replayer that needs more than one unit on a blend is a defect to fix or a case for a new ADR — not a
reason to widen the bound.

<a id="input"></a>
## Input and focus

A runner turns its host's events into the AD-14 input records and feeds them to `advance` with the tick they belong to:
`key { code, char, vk, down, repeat? }` — a physical key in the host's own identifier space, the character it produced
or `null`, its virtual-key number or `null`, and the optional `repeat` flag for host auto-repeat, which is not a new
press edge; `pointer` in logical integer pixels; `gamepad` with a **physical** standard-layout button bitmask
([E-112](display-input-audio.md#reawakened-gamepad-contract)); `focus { lost | gained }`.

**A runner maps, it does not name.** `core` turns each key into its binding control (`key:<code>`,
[ACT-3](display-input-audio.md#act-3)) and into its legacy queue name, so a script sees `LEFT` and `" "` on every host
([E-110: key names](display-input-audio.md#reawakened-key-name)). A runner supplies the identifiers its host actually reports; it
never decides what a key is called and never decides what it does.

Focus is the core's, not the runner's: after `focus.lost` the core consumes no ticks until `focus.gained` (E-03). A
runner keeps calling `advance` — it must not stop its own loop — and lets the core return `ticksRun: 0`. A runner
sends only the `focus` record on blur and never synthesises key-ups: on `focus.lost` the core itself releases every held
keyboard key, because the host reports no key-up for a key released while its window is unfocused
([held direction movement](display-input-audio.md#reawakened-held-direction-movement), rule 4).

Unlock is a runner event, not an input: a browser's first gesture releases audio without the core ever seeing it
([audio-media.md#audio-autoplay](audio-media.md#audio-autoplay)).

<a id="audio"></a>
## Audio

The runner plays the cue stream through the audio protocol v1 messages and reports the one reply the core accepts —
`audio.ended { cueId }` — as an AD-14 input (AD-16). The cue-to-message mapping is
[audio-media.md#cue-player](audio-media.md#cue-player) and the message and event records are
[audio-media.md#runner-audio-protocol](audio-media.md#runner-audio-protocol); this page does not restate either.

Three runner rules come with the contract, and all three are the runner's, not the core's: the autoplay unlock of
[audio-autoplay](audio-media.md#audio-autoplay), the focus hold of [audio-focus](audio-media.md#audio-focus) (the
default is `"pause"`), and the late-sound drop of [audio-late-sounds](audio-media.md#audio-late-sounds) measured from
ready, not from receipt. A blocking asset request freezes core ticks and adds no lateness by itself; decode time after
the reply does.

A runner also owns the player's preferences — per-bus volume and mute, and the bank picker — and the shared bank cache
of [audio-media.md#audio-soundfont-cache](audio-media.md#audio-soundfont-cache): banks keyed by the SHA-256 of their
bytes, cached per runner and shared across games, with eviction that never removes the bank in use.

**What is implemented today** (entries 5 and 6). `synth` carries the cue player: `cueStart` is the table's `media.play`,
`media.seek` and `media.fade` arithmetic as a pure function of the cue and the tick the voice became ready, and
`CuePlayer` is the state machine over it — the `(track, voice)` map, the prepared voice from `media.load`, the
pre-ready message queue, the autoplay lock's mirror and the focus hold. `runner-web` carries the output: `PcmSink` holds
one `synth` source voice per protocol voice and **pulls** frames. The shipped graph runs that pull inside an
**AudioWorklet** (`apps/audio-worklet.js`), so the render quantum is the browser's render-quantum size rather than a
fixed `ScriptProcessorNode` buffer; the one-shot onset target is **≤ 50 ms** measured as
`baseLatency + renderQuantumSize / sampleRate`, and the browser lane asserts it. A `ScriptProcessorNode` fallback
remains only for a platform that genuinely lacks AudioWorklet; it is logged explicitly and uses a documented
2048-frame buffer. Bus, master and voice volumes are applied at the pull either way. The four bank ranks of
[audio-media.md#soundfont-layers](audio-media.md#soundfont-layers) resolve in `synth` (`effectiveBank`: player, author,
runner, bundled — never a fifth, which MEDIA-5 retired), a bank is validated as a RIFF `sfbk` container against the
runner's ceiling (`bank.invalid`, `bank.unavailable`), and `BankCache` keys it by the SHA-256 of its bytes so two games
that name the same bytes share one entry and a swap never evicts the bank a voice holds. The bundled layer is
`media/soundfonts/TK-16.sf2`, whose hash the notice records and whose licence is CC0-1.0; it loads and MIDI renders
through it in Node and in headless Chromium. Its selection as a *default* remains the owner's listening approval (PB-10),
so a host that wants the bank off passes no bundled layer.

The **video** half is
[audio-media.md#video-request](audio-media.md#video-request): `VideoHost` answers every `playVideo` with exactly one `video.ended { reqId }`
(including every failure), keeps one video outstanding, and holds the other realised voices through the cue player's
`videoStarted`/`videoEnded` while the core's own restart cue returns the music. No VP9/WebM fixture ships yet, so the
lane proves the missing, undecodable and busy paths; the played path is entry 7's.

<a id="desktop-shell"></a>
## The desktop applications

There are **two desktop applications from one codebase**, and one ruled shell for both. The **player** is a
distribution artefact; the **editor** is its own package and application, with its own `platform-services`
instantiation, the harness embedded for preview, and its own update cadence. The player is not a stripped editor, the
editor is not a mode of the player, and neither is the PWA.

Both are **Electron 45.2.1** (Chromium 156.0.8078.75), ruled in [ADR 0013](../../adr/0013-desktop-shell-electron.md),
and both:

- serve every page over a **privileged `app://` scheme** — `standard`, `secure`, `supportFetchAPI`, `corsEnabled` —
  registered before `app.ready`, and never load a page with `loadFile`. A `file://` page cannot be trusted with the
  audio graph: in a system WebView it refuses `audioWorklet.addModule` under a cross-origin rule, and WebKit cannot
  register a service worker at all without a browser entitlement. The scheme is what keeps loading a game from an
  arbitrary path from being what breaks sound;
- register **no service worker**. A desktop application is already offline; the only artefact with a worker is the PWA
  ([offline](#offline));
- provide `platform-services`, an asset source for a folder or a package, and the save-blob host behind AD-17's keys.

**The player's launch resolution** is fixed, in this order, and is the only mechanism:

1. an explicit `--game <path>` argument, or a deep link;
2. a configuration file by convention — `player.json` beside the executable, or, when installed, in the operating
   system's configuration directory for the application;
3. an embedded default project baked in at export;
4. if none of those name a project, the installed-game library.

Handing somebody "the player plus my game" is therefore a pre-configured build or a configuration file, never a
per-game stub. There is **no file association to rely on**: an association is a promise the OS lets a user break and
does not exist in the PWA. A cold start with nothing configured shows the library and says why, never a blank window.

**The editor application** is epic `desktop-shell`'s (`host-desktop`): its own package, its own measurements, its own
signing/notarisation/updater and its own cadence. This page rules only what both applications share — the shell, the
scheme, the absence of a worker and the `platform-services` surface.

<a id="install"></a>
## Install, the library and the descriptor

A game is **data**, not an executable. An export writes a distribution package — a `.tpk`-compatible ZIP with
`manifest.json { schema, main, index }` — plus an **install descriptor**, and installing means **registering the package
with the player**, never wrapping it.

The library is a host-side registry, outside the save store: AD-17's blob keys are untouched. It holds each installed
package's identity (the manifest's `schema` and `main`, and the descriptor's `sha256` and `size`), its path on the
desktop or its OPFS handle on the web, that game's settings, and the **default game**. On the desktop it is a small
versioned JSON file in the application-data directory beside the installed packages; in the PWA it is a `library`
directory and index in OPFS, with Cache Storage left to the app shell under [offline](#offline).

Core stays I/O-free (G2): the application resolves a library entry and hands `core` the package's bytes through the
existing asset source. `core` never knows a registry exists, and an install is not a save.

The descriptor is a **sibling file** the exporter writes next to the package, `<package>.tpk.json`, with
`{ schema, file, sha256, size, gameId, title, version }` — see
[../formats/packaging-and-paths.md#install-descriptor](../formats/packaging-and-paths.md#install-descriptor). The
package's own manifest keeps exactly three fields, because AD-6 refuses any other.

<a id="load-modes"></a>
## Load modes and the threshold

The web player has two load modes. At or below the threshold it downloads the whole distribution package behind a
progress screen and keeps it. Above the threshold it validates the whole archive first, then discards nonessential
bytes and fetches entries on demand by validated ranges. **The first launch in streaming mode still transfers the
whole package**; it bounds retained memory rather than avoiding that initial download. Validation preserves the
archive's existing safety and integrity checks and verifies its size, SHA-256 and content-derived identity. This
behavior follows the owner's OQ1 approval for issue #934.

The threshold is **measured, not asserted**: it is the uncompressed size of the largest corpus package, including its
manifest, rounded up to the next whole mebibyte. The measurement builds packages from all games in the pinned fetched
corpus, using the closing plan to select each main file, and checks the resulting archives.

| Corpus | Largest package | Threshold | Measured |
|---|---|---|---|
| 8 fetched corpus games | ChimeranEmpire: 32175677 bytes | 31 MiB | 2026-11-01 |

A package in the cache is keyed by the SHA-256 of its bytes. Per-entry hashes and delta updates are deferred until a
second published package version exists, because they would otherwise amend AD-6 and the manifest contract for a
benefit no artefact can use.

<a id="prefetch"></a>
## Prefetch hints

The **core** computes the deterministic prefetch plan and sends it as tiered hints at the AD-5 seam; a runner only
fetches and decodes ahead. A runner **MUST NOT** parse a board to guess what to prefetch — that duplicates the board
reader in every host.

| Tier | What is in it |
|---|---|
| `now` | the current board's resolved `bkgMusic`, and the default bank when that music is MIDI |
| `next` | the resolved music of edge-linked boards whose bytes are already cached, excluding program links; the current battle background's nonempty `music`, `menuMoveSound`, `menuChooseSound`, `readySound` and `cantDoSound` fields when available |
| `always` | the main file's `cursorMoveSound`, `cursorSelectSound` and `cursorCancelSound`, and the default bank |

The planner does not currently hint other current-board assets, animation frame sounds, or literal `send(...)` targets.
It deduplicates keys across tiers, keeping the earliest tier, and sorts keys within each tier. The battle background may
need a separate prefetch-only asset request before its sound fields become available. Such a request never blocks
ticking or loading; a late successful reply emits a changed plan when its facts are ready. A missing or undecodable
reply is remembered as unavailable for the engine session and is not requested again. An undecodable reply reports an
`asset.invalid` diagnostic with the key and parser error; it does not stop the engine. This prefetch-only negative
cache is not saved and is excluded from state and draw hashes. It does not prevent a separate gameplay asset request.

A hint **never blocks**, **never changes state**, **never appears in a state or draw hash**, and **never earns a reply**.
The wire record is an AD-5 and AD-17 amendment, added by entry 8. The owner approved this correction to the landed
planner's behavior on 2026-11-01 (issue #934, OQ4); it supersedes the broader proposed table in
[audio-media.md#audio-prefetch](audio-media.md#audio-prefetch).

The web runner reports one diagnostic about hints, `shared`: the keys whose audio-cue read was served by a read that a
hint began. In plain terms, it is evidence that a prefetch hint, and not an eager package, a blocking request or the cue
itself, did the loading a cue then used. Technically a key is recorded only when the cue's own read of it, at that
moment, found bytes in the cache or joined a read still in flight **and** those bytes came from a read that a hint
started. A hint that names a key whose bytes were already cached, or whose read a blocking request or a cue had already
started, earns no credit; neither do bytes the cache no longer holds (replaced or evicted and fetched again) or a read
that failed. It is evidence a test can assert, not a performance metric, and like every hint it changes no state, hash or
reply.

<a id="offline"></a>
## The PWA and offline play

The PWA is the web player, and it is the **only artefact this epic ships with a service worker**; the editor PWA is
`host-web`'s and its worker is epic `editor-foundation`'s. Neither desktop application registers one.

The worker caches the app shell, the bundled default bank and the whole-package download, and it updates on the **next
launch** and **never** mid-session. Save blobs go through `saveBlob` / `loadBlob` / `listBlobs` under `GameId`-keyed
paths and the worker never reads a save. The runner **SHOULD** call `navigator.storage.persist()` and **MUST** report an
unpersisted or quota-limited state rather than swallowing it, falling back to streaming for anything it cannot keep. No
background sync, push, accounts or telemetry are added.

<a id="mobile"></a>
## The mobile wrapper

`runner-mobile` is the `runner-web` build inside **Capacitor 8.5.3** and nothing else: it proves one sample game on a
real device or emulator and carries the same asset source and the same AD-17 blob keys, with the Capacitor filesystem
behind them. Store submission, signing, icons, splash screens, deep links and per-platform chrome are out of scope and
belong to a release owner that does not exist yet.

The wrapper **MUST NOT** fork the player: a platform difference is a host service or a policy on this page, never a
second rendering or input path.

<a id="build"></a>
## Build and artefact shape

The browser artefacts are bundled with **esbuild 0.28.2** — the bundler AD-22 names for `host-vscode`, MIT licensed.
Vite **MUST NOT** be installed: it pulls `lightningcss` (MPL-2.0) and would need its own ADR before a first install, and
nothing here needs HMR. See [ADR 0015](../../adr/0015-web-build-and-test-toolchain.md).

The engine worker and the AudioWorklet are **single-file IIFE bundles with no runtime `import()`**. The player page is a
static HTML file plus one bundle, served in development and in the browser tests by a small static server; no framework
and no dev server enters the shipped artefact. The same `tsc -b` output feeds the browser bundle and the headless runner,
which is what "the same core build" in the capability's success check means.

<a id="csp-and-banks"></a>
## CSP and the audio path

The default audio path ships **SF2** banks only, so it instantiates **no WebAssembly** and the shipped CSP needs no
`wasm-unsafe-eval` for it. `script-src 'wasm-unsafe-eval'` is allowed only in a build that can load an SF3 bank or a
user-supplied `.sf2` that is SF3, and the page states which build it is.

The browser lane **MUST** assert that the default path instantiates no WebAssembly, so the allowance can never widen
silently. SF3 support itself is unverified and is not promised by this page.

The AudioWorklet module is loaded by `audioWorklet.addModule` from a **same-origin** URL — `/apps/audio-worklet.js` in
the browser and `app://player/apps/audio-worklet.js` under the desktop scheme. That fetch is governed by `script-src`,
**not** `worker-src`, so the shipped `script-src 'self'` covers it and the policy is not widened. The browser lane loads
the module under the real CSP; the desktop smoke does the same over `app://`.

<a id="conformance-lane"></a>
## Conformance: the schema and the vector kit

A runner proves itself by replaying vectors, not by sharing types. Two artefacts do that:

- **the schema** — `packages/runner-harness/schema/runner-protocol-v1.schema.json`, one JSON Schema for every record
  this page's boundary carries, with fixed keys and `null` for absence (AD-14). A non-TypeScript runner validates its
  messages against it;
- **the vector kit** — `tools/fixtures/runner-protocol/`, a generator with a `--check` mode on the
  `audio-protocol:check` pattern. It holds one record per kind across the three families — a draw list, an input record and
  a host request — each with the verdict a conforming schema must return, plus the refusals a runner must reject (an
  unknown kind, an omitted required key, an out-of-range value, a non-`https:` URL). A runner passes by validating and
  replaying them.

The schema, the kit and the TypeScript types cannot drift from one another: **`pnpm runner-protocol:check`** fails when
any one of them changes alone. It runs, in this order, and reports every problem it finds:

1. **The kit is reproducible.** It regenerates the vectors and fails if the committed `vectors.json` differs.
2. **The schema is well formed.** Every `$ref` resolves, every `$defs` entry is reachable from the three roots
   (`drawList`, `inputRecord`, `request`), every object is closed (`additionalProperties: false`) with every `required`
   key declared, and only the JSON Schema keywords the checker evaluates appear, so a keyword it would silently ignore
   cannot weaken the schema.
3. **The schema and the kit agree.** Every vector's verdict matches what the schema returns: a valid record is accepted
   and a refusal is refused. A kit that holds no valid record for some kind the schema lists fails.
4. **The schema and the TypeScript types agree.** The check reads `DrawList`, `InputRecord` and `RunnerRequest` from
   `packages/core/src/ports/` with the TypeScript compiler and compares each with its schema definition in the JSON
   projection, recursively: the keys a record carries, which are required (every key but `repeat`, AD-14), literal and
   enum values, `null`, arrays, records and nested objects, with a `Uint8Array` leaf as a base64 string. It names the
   path of every difference, so a type change with no schema change, or the reverse, fails. Numeric bounds, string
   patterns and lengths exist only in the schema (TypeScript has no integer type), and the refusals in the kit hold
   them.

`packages/core` also fails its own type check when a request kind is missing from `HOST_REQUEST_KINDS`, so a request
kind cannot be added to the wire without being declarable by a package. The same check, plus perturbation tests that
prove schema-only, TypeScript-only and vector-only changes each fail, run under `pnpm fixtures:test`.

The browser lane is **Playwright 1.64.0** (Apache-2.0, Blue Oak Gold), one headless Chromium project, a required `gate`
dependency that runs `pnpm fixtures:fetch` first and serves the fetched `fixtures/` folder over the local static server.
Its licence, and why it is a dev-only tool outside the production-tree scan, are recorded in
[ADR 0015](../../adr/0015-web-build-and-test-toolchain.md). No test reaches the network.
