# Runners

What a runner is, what it must do, and what it is allowed to decide. This page is the normative contract between the
core and any runner — browser, desktop application, mobile wrapper or the headless harness — and it is the page a
non-TypeScript runner is written against.

It exists because the owner ruled on 2026-10-31 that **the runners in any language share one shape**: the behaviour is
normative prose, the boundary is plain data, and a conformance kit decides who complies. The TypeScript packages are
one binding of this page, never the contract itself.

**Status.** This page is normative from its landing date. The runner packages exist in `packages/` today: `runner-harness` (the conformance harness and its schema) and `runner-headless` (the headless golden lane) landed first, and epic `web-runner-packaging` has since built `runner-web`, `runner-desktop` and `runner-mobile`; the table at [Implementation status](#implementation-status) names which entry delivers each section. Nothing here describes a feature that no entry will build; where a section names a file, that file is that entry's destination.

**What this page does not restate.** The engine API is AD-1; the draw
command union is AD-3; the event union is AD-14; the request union is AD-17; audio cues are AD-16 and
[audio-media.md#runner-audio-protocol](audio-media.md#runner-audio-protocol). Those pages own the record shapes. This
page owns the runner's obligations, the latitude it has, and the checks that prove it.

<a id="boundary"></a>
## The boundary

A runner is everything outside `core` that makes a game visible and audible. It owns four jobs and no others:

| Job | It receives | It must not |
|---|---|---|
| Replay draw lists | a `DrawList` per frame (AD-3) | own the game loop, hold game state, run game logic, or call into `core` except through the engine API (G4) |
| Play audio | `AudioCue` records and the audio protocol's messages (AD-16, [audio-media.md#runner-audio-protocol](audio-media.md#runner-audio-protocol)) | change a cue's meaning, invent or drop an `audio.ended` a cue owes, or send anything back except an AD-14 input |
| Deliver input | the host's own events | decide a tick, reorder a tick's events, or write the input log (AD-14: the core writes it) |
| Service requests | `TickReport.requests` (AD-5, AD-17) | return bytes any other way, cache a reply's *content* as state, or block the simulation itself |

The core never waits on a runner except through a blocking request, never reads anything back except an AD-14 input, and
never learns a runner's name. Everything a runner sends the core is an input `{ tick, event }`; everything the core
sends a runner is plain data — structured-cloneable, fixed keys, absent values `null` (AD-1, AD-14).
<a id="quit-request-order"></a>
**Quit and blob-write ordering (OWNER; ruled 2026-11-02).** Quit does not cancel a blob write issued before it. The core and runner MUST preserve each write's position relative to quit even when a game save is not serialized until later: the core MUST settle post-quit writes as failed without publishing them, and MUST publish a pre-quit game save only after the in-flight requests that affect its snapshot have settled. The runner MUST complete every `saveBlob` request before quit in `TickReport.requests` before disposing session resources or notifying `onQuit`, and MUST NOT dispatch writes after quit. The core MUST order writes on the appropriate side of quit by when the script requested them, not when deferred request bytes become available; it does not order two writes on the same side of quit.

<a id="runner-may-decide"></a>
## What a runner may decide, and what it may not

**May:** the output API (WebGL2, Canvas2D, a native surface), buffer sizes and threading, which work runs in a worker,
which sources and banks are installed, presentation scaling and letterboxing (AD-33), where a save physically lives
(AD-17), and the player-facing preferences of [audio-media.md#soundfont-layers](audio-media.md#soundfont-layers).

- **May not:** change the meaning of a record, drop or invent a reply the core expects (AD-5, AD-14), feed raw device or display observations directly into simulation, depend on how ticks were batched (AD-1), or keep anything caches hold observable: discarding a cache at any moment must change no pixel, no sound and no hash (G4 rule 3). A host observation may affect simulation only when captured as the initial host records or as the explicit, tick-stamped `host.features` / `host.display` AD-14 input in [host-capabilities-and-viewports.md#state-and-input-records](host-capabilities-and-viewports.md#state-and-input-records). Those records are hashed because script-visible; the runner's raw observation and presentation transform are not.
- **Pointer and geometry state:** mapping a physical pointer through the displayed game rectangle is presentation work, but the resulting logical pointer input is an AD-14 input and the current normalized display geometry is deterministic state. Therefore a runner MUST use the same measured game rectangle for pointer mapping and `host.display` inputs; it MUST NOT mutate core geometry through an out-of-band setter.

<a id="draw-list"></a>
## Draw-list replay and the presented frame

A runner replays the `DrawList` of the current tick and nothing more (G4). Two obligations follow.

**Protocol version selection.** The current draw-list boundary is runner-protocol-v3: each frame carries the required
`protocolVersion: 3` marker. A renderer and reference replay MUST reject a missing or unsupported marker before drawing;
they MUST NOT treat an unknown version as v2 or infer it from the commands. The marker is part of the draw hash. This
repository's in-process hosts and bundled renderer consume v3; there is no independent network negotiation protocol.
An external producer/runner MUST agree on v3 before exchanging these frames and fail closed if it cannot. The historical
v1 and v2 schemas, vector kits and corresponding TypeScript frame types remain unchanged. In particular, the v2 schema
rejects a v3 frame (even one containing no new blend mode), and the v3 schema rejects an unmarked v2 frame.

**Scaling is presentation.** The core emits a draw list for the logical viewport; a runner maps it to the physical
display in one of the two modes AD-33 allows — integer-scaled pixel-perfect letterbox, or responsive expand-viewport —
chosen by the player, never by the game state. `alpha` is presentation-only and is excluded from state and draw hashes,
so a runner may interpolate between ticks and may not let interpolation reach anything the core reads.

**Desktop fit — Approved ruling (owner: Jensen, 2026-11-02).** Show the whole game frame, centred on a black
surround, even when the window or display is too small for its original size. Enlarge it in whole-number steps when
possible, keeping its proportions; the only non-integer case is shrinking a frame that cannot fit at 1×.

For logical dimensions `W × H` and available content dimensions `Cw × Ch`, let
`r = min(Cw / W, Ch / H)`. Use `floor(r)` when `r >= 1`, otherwise use `r` without integer rounding. Present
the frame at `W × scale` by `H × scale`, centred in the content area; any fractional margins are shared equally.
Recompute on content-area resize, including changes imposed by display constraints. Map pointer coordinates through
the same presented rectangle back to logical coordinates. This transformation is presentation only and changes
neither simulation state nor its hash.

**Textures come from the core, not from the runner's own decoder.** A runner fetches asset bytes through an AD-5
request; the core decodes them (AD-28) and the runner pulls pixels it needs from surfaces with
`engine.surfacePixels(id, rev)` (AD-27). A runner may keep a texture, glyph-atlas or tile cache keyed by `(id, rev)`,
because `rev` increments on every mutation and an unknown or stale `rev` returns `null`; it must be able to refill at
any time, and a test that flushes every cache every frame must produce identical pixels.

<a id="picture-pixels"></a>
**A composed picture is a texture the core supplies.** A tile bitmap is one picture whose pixels are built from other
tiles ([tiles.md#tile-bitmap-tbm](../formats/tiles.md#tile-bitmap-tbm)), so a runner MUST NOT compose it, lower it to
cell blits or decode it from its bytes. When a draw names such an asset — a board image, a battle background, a sprite
animation frame — the runner gets its straight-RGBA pixels from `engine.picturePixels(key)` and uploads them like any
other texture; `null` means the core has not decoded that picture, which a runner reports as a deferred command for
that frame, never as a guess. Lowering a picture to independent cell blits is not equivalent: a later cell that the
picture's transparent colour keys out must still erase what an earlier cell painted under it, and every tile must be
clipped to the picture's own `width · 32 × height · 32` bounds.

<a id="blit-pipeline"></a>
**Pixel pipeline of a `blit` — a runner MUST apply these stages in this order.** A blit carries the colour key (`key`),
the world tint (`tint`), `alpha` and `blend`:

1. **Skip and key.** A pixel whose alpha is zero is not drawn. `key` is tested against the sampled texel exactly; for
   a composed picture the texel already carries every authored effect, including a tile bitmap cell's own shade, so
   the transparent colour is tested on the picture's finished pixels ([tiles.md#tile-bitmap-tbm](../formats/tiles.md#tile-bitmap-tbm)).
2. **World stage.** Apply `tint` — the pre-summed board shading and ambient — to the sampled texel under the R-15 rule
   ([tiles.md#shading](../formats/tiles.md#shading)): remap pure white to `245` and pure black to `10` when this tint
   is non-zero, add it, and clamp once.
3. **Blend.** `normal`, `additive`, `translucent`, or v3 `source-over` (AD-3). Source and target are straight-alpha RGBA. For `source-over`, let `a = floor(sourceAlpha × alpha / 255)`, `d = targetAlpha`, and `n = a × 255 + d × (255 − a)`. If `n` is zero, leave the target unchanged; otherwise the output alpha is `floor((n + 127) / 255)` and each output colour channel is `floor((source × a × 255 + target × d × (255 − a) + floor(n / 2)) / n)`. Thus a partially transparent destination is not treated as opaque. The normal mode still replaces, not composites. An enabled render-now overlay uses `source-over` so its straight-alpha ink covers the frame once.

**Text coverage.** Each glyph coverage value is a source alpha for the command's straight RGB colour. Composite it source-over the current straight-alpha target using the same integer rule above (with `a = coverage`), including transparent and translucent targets. An edge of white ink over transparent pixels therefore retains RGB `(255,255,255)` with alpha equal to its coverage; consumers must not multiply the colour a second time.
An opaque host framebuffer presents a straight-alpha pixel over black. An alpha-capable WebGL host with `premultipliedAlpha: false` receives straight RGBA; with `premultipliedAlpha: true`, the renderer premultiplies RGB at presentation only, so browser composition produces the same visible result. Internal planes remain straight alpha in both cases.

The order is part of the agreement bound below: **colour-key exclusion is compared exactly**, so a runner that keys
after the world tint fails the colour-key vectors.

<a id="surface-read-and-state-hash"></a>
## Surface reads, presentation and game state

**Approved ruling (owner: Jensen, 2026-11-02).** Showing a frame must not change the game merely because a runner
looks at its pixels. The presented screen surface is a derived presentation cache, not game progress. It is excluded
from the state hash and is rebuilt deterministically on restore before any script reads it. This combines the
2026-11-01 option C ruling with the read-only host-accessor rule; it replaces the earlier wording that an owner
decision on that rule was required. The core implements it as described below (issue #1048).

Owner ruling (Jensen, 2026-11-01), approved option C, verbatim:
> the presented screen surface is a derived cache excluded from the hash, rebuilt deterministically on restore before any script read; script-owned canvases (`cnvX`) remain hashed.

Follow-up approved ruling (owner: Jensen, 2026-11-02), verbatim:
> RPGCode script-owned canvases (cnvX) are application store, treated like global variables — they STAY in the state hash, and drawing to them legitimately changes it. Only the presented screen surface (the derived presentation cache) is excluded. Hash-significant: script variables/globals, cnvX canvases, game-loop globals needed to store coordinates. Hash-neutral: drawing to / reading / refreshing the presented screen surface and any host surfacePixels poll.

`engine.surfacePixels(id, rev)` **MUST** be observationally read-only. It returns an owned copy of the requested
stored revision, or `null` if the id or revision is unavailable. It **MUST NOT** mutate `GameState`, surface revisions,
the state hash or save data, or change future diagnostics, regardless of host polling or cache-flush cadence.
Refreshing the screen for script-visible `getpixel`, `canvasgetscreen` or `savescreen` is a deterministic core
operation, separate from host presentation reads. A runner cannot trigger that operation by polling.

**Enforcement by type/API rather than convention (answering the open question on #1048):**
Host accessor purity is guaranteed structurally rather than by trusting runners or developers to follow convention:
1. **Type signature:** `surfacePixels(id: SurfaceId, rev: number): SurfacePixels | null` is typed as a read-only query taking primitive values and returning `{ readonly w: number, readonly h: number, readonly rgba: Bytes } | null`. It accepts no callbacks, configuration flags, or mutable contexts.
2. **API separation:** `surfacePixels` resolves the stored entry and revision without invoking a rebuild. Currently the core rebuilds at the end of `advance`, on a script screen read, or on restore. The approved deterministic rebuild-before-read rule remains binding; reconstructing the target's history-dependent frame and its precise timing remain unresolved.
3. **Detached buffer ownership:** The returned `rgba` byte buffer is a newly allocated copy (`new Uint8Array(entry.bitmap.data)`), so runners can retain, wrap, or mutate it without corrupting the engine's internal state.

**Two surfaces, not one.** A script that draws and names no canvas draws to the **script-screen layer**, a persistent
surface with the reserved id `-1`. The id is fixed, never taken from the monotonic counter, so the first draw to the
screen moves neither the counter nor any canvas handle, and a script cannot name the layer (handles are never
negative). In the current implementation the layer is composited between the live board and overlay while an
outermost program runs; this is an implementation gap, not the target. The owner chose the Toolkit 3.1 model
for now: a running program presents its own surface with the message window on top, without live board or overlay
composition. Board redraws replace that surface. The starting frame is core-composed, with no host pixel request.
See [ADR 0018](../../adr/0018-core-composed-program-starting-frame.md) and
[main-loop-and-startup.md#reawakened-starting-frame-capture](main-loop-and-startup.md#reawakened-starting-frame-capture).
Both existing surfaces are saved; neither is hashed. The storage and save/hash treatment of retained prior-frame
history are unresolved and are not decided by these existing exclusions.

**Current implementation: when the core rebuilds the frame.** The core rebuilds surface 0 from game state alone, and only at three points: at
the end of every `advance` call; immediately before a script reads the screen (`getpixel` on the screen,
`canvasgetscreen`, `savescreen`, and a canvas draw whose source is the screen); and when a saved game is restored,
before any script runs. A rebuild is skipped when the frame it would render is the one already rebuilt — the same
draw-list size and commands (the tick stamp is not part of the comparison) and no asset has arrived since — and a
restore always rebuilds. In the current implementation pixels and revisions can differ between `advance` batchings and host reads do not cause rebuilds. The adopted target must additionally preserve the correct history-dependent script-visible pixels and G3 determinism: exclusion of surface 0 from the hash does not make different future screen-read results harmless. A state edit currently appears at the next `advance` or script read, never on a host read.

**What leaves the hash and what stays:**
The hash includes the application store: script variables and globals, script-owned canvases (`cnvX`), and game-loop
globals needed to store coordinates. Drawing to `cnvX` changes the hash when it changes that store, just as changing a
global variable does. Drawing to, reading or refreshing the screen — the script-screen layer and the presented frame
alike — is hash-neutral. A script that needs screen content later captures it into a canvas or a numbered slot, and
those are store.
Moving a player changes character state and therefore should change the hash; viewing the screen more often must not.
See [the surface hash projection](../formats/save-game.md#state-hash-surface-projection).
Jensen's principle is: “Drawing to the surfaces shouldn't cause a hash change. The only reason the hash should change
is if the application store changed, e.g. rpgcode surface plus some of the game-loop globals needed to store
coordinates.”
Conformance compares the same game and inputs with no host reads, repeated reads, cache-flush reads and stale-revision
reads: per-tick hashes, save data, revisions and future diagnostics must agree. It checks that a `cnvX` draw that
changes the store moves the hash, while drawing to, reading or refreshing the presented screen and host polling do not.
It also checks deterministic rebuild before script reads and preserves script-visible screen capture behavior.

<a id="webgl2-agreement"></a>
## The WebGL2 agreement bound

The WebGL2 replayer and the reference rasteriser in `core/raster` are compared per draw command, on the conformance
vectors and on every gating golden scene:

- **exactly** on every decision the CPU pipeline makes discretely — colour-key exclusion, tint saturation, and the
  choice of blend;
- **within one unit per channel** on the arithmetic a GPU may round differently, which is the `translucent`,
  `additive`, and v3 `source-over` blend of AD-3's pixel pipeline, with the worst per-channel difference reported per vector.

**What is drawn today.** Entry 4 replays all eight commands of AD-3's union — `fill`, `rect`, `line`, `ellipse`, `blit`
(with the `.iso` projection and persistent surfaces), `text`, `pushTarget` and `popTarget` — at the draw list's logical
resolution, with AD-33's two presentation modes as viewport geometry. The pixel sets a GPU cannot derive on its own come
from `core/raster`'s leaves rather than from a second implementation: `linePixels`, `rectOutlinePixels`,
`ellipsePixels`, `isoSourceOffset` and `textInk` (which owns the legacy cell scaling, the italic shear, bold's second ink
and the TrueType outline's coverage), plus `DEFAULT_FONT_ASSET` for AD-15's substitution of a family the game does not
ship. A TrueType `text` command carries glyph IDs, which only the face that produced them can draw, so a host **MUST**
give the renderer every face the engine installed from the project's `Font\` folder as well as the bundled faces, decoded
once and shared across frames; the interactive session offers a project face only while the engine reports it installed
(`boot.fonts`), and a project face wins over a bundled face of the same key. A tiled blit uploads only the tile it
names, because a `.tst` strip of a large board can exceed `MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE` and an incomplete texture samples as black.

A renderer that cannot draw a command **MUST** count it as deferred and report a diagnostic, never draw an approximate
pixel in its place. A frame that reports a deferred command is a partial frame, not a pass; the browser lane today
reports none on any gating ledger row or committed vector.

This bound never widens a PNG golden: `independent-reference` and `regression-baseline` rows stay exact
([parity-checklist.md#golden-image-oracle](parity-checklist.md#golden-image-oracle)), and a `legacy-screenshot` row stays
report-only. A replayer that needs more than one unit on a blend is a defect to fix or a case for a new ADR — not a
reason to widen the bound.

<a id="input"></a>
## Input and focus

A runner turns its host's events into the AD-14 input records and feeds them to `advance` with the tick they belong to:
The record kinds include:
`key { code, char, vk, down, repeat? }` — a physical key in the host's own identifier space, the character it produced
or `null`, its virtual-key number or `null`, and the optional `repeat` flag for host auto-repeat, which is not a new
press edge; `pointer` in logical integer pixels; `gamepad` with a **physical** standard-layout button bitmask and
`host.gamepads` with the complete current set of connected normalized standard-layout devices, as specified in
[E-112](display-input-audio.md#reawakened-gamepad-contract); `host.features`, `host.display`; `focus { lost | gained }`.

When a successful `blob.loaded` installs saved state, the runner MUST append fresh `host.features` and `host.gamepads`
records after that reply. Core applies them before resumed script execution, even if the request pump performs several
internal advances. The v2 snapshot lists connected devices sorted by normalized index; an omitted device is disconnected.

**A runner maps, it does not name.** `core` turns each key into its binding control (`key:<code>`,
[ACT-3](display-input-audio.md#act-3)) and into its legacy queue name, so a script sees `LEFT` and `" "` on every host
([E-110: key names](display-input-audio.md#reawakened-key-name)). A runner supplies the identifiers its host actually reports; it
never decides what a key is called and never decides what it does.

Focus is the core's, not the runner's: after `focus.lost` the core consumes no ticks until `focus.gained` (E-03). A
runner keeps calling `advance` — it must not stop its own loop — and lets the core return `ticksRun: 0`. A runner
sends only the `focus` record on blur and never synthesises key-ups: on `focus.lost` the core itself releases every held
keyboard key, because the host reports no key-up for a key released while its window is unfocused
([held direction movement](display-input-audio.md#reawakened-held-direction-movement), rule 4).

Unlock is a runner event, not an input: a browser's first gesture releases audio without the core ever seeing it
([audio-media.md#audio-autoplay](audio-media.md#audio-autoplay)).

<a id="audio"></a>
## Audio

The runner plays the cue stream through the audio protocol v1 messages and reports the one reply the core accepts —
`audio.ended { cueId }` — as an AD-14 input (AD-16). The cue-to-message mapping is
[audio-media.md#cue-player](audio-media.md#cue-player) and the message and event records are
[audio-media.md#runner-audio-protocol](audio-media.md#runner-audio-protocol); this page does not restate either.

Three runner rules come with the contract, and all three are the runner's, not the core's: the autoplay unlock of
[audio-autoplay](audio-media.md#audio-autoplay), the focus hold of [audio-focus](audio-media.md#audio-focus) (the
default is `"pause"`), and the late-sound drop of [audio-late-sounds](audio-media.md#audio-late-sounds) measured from
ready, not from receipt. A blocking asset request freezes core ticks and adds no lateness by itself; decode time after
the reply does.

A runner also owns the player's preferences — per-bus volume and mute, and the bank picker — and the shared bank cache
of [audio-media.md#audio-soundfont-cache](audio-media.md#audio-soundfont-cache): banks keyed by the SHA-256 of their
bytes, cached per runner and shared across games, with eviction that never removes the bank in use.

**What is implemented today** (entries 5 and 6). `synth` carries the cue player: `cueStart` is the table's `media.play`,
`media.seek` and `media.fade` arithmetic as a pure function of the cue and the tick the voice became ready, and
`CuePlayer` is the state machine over it — the `(track, voice)` map, the prepared voice from `media.load`, the
pre-ready message queue, the autoplay lock's mirror and the focus hold. `runner-web` carries the output: `PcmSink` holds
one `synth` source voice per protocol voice and **pulls** frames. The shipped graph runs that pull inside an
**AudioWorklet** (`apps/browser/audio-worklet.js`, `apps/desktop/audio-worklet.js` or `apps/mobile/audio-worklet.js`), so the render quantum is the browser's render-quantum size rather than a
fixed `ScriptProcessorNode` buffer; the one-shot onset target is **≤ 50 ms** measured as
`baseLatency + renderQuantumSize / sampleRate`, and the browser lane asserts it. A `ScriptProcessorNode` fallback
remains only for a platform that genuinely lacks AudioWorklet; it is logged explicitly and uses a documented
2048-frame buffer. Bus, master and voice volumes are applied at the pull either way. The four bank ranks of
[audio-media.md#soundfont-layers](audio-media.md#soundfont-layers) resolve in `synth` (`effectiveBank`: player, author,
runner, bundled — never a fifth, which MEDIA-5 retired), a bank is validated as a RIFF `sfbk` container against the
runner's ceiling (`bank.invalid`, `bank.unavailable`), and `BankCache` keys it by the SHA-256 of its bytes so two games
that name the same bytes share one entry and a swap never evicts the bank a voice holds. The bundled layer is
`media/soundfonts/TK-16.sf2`, whose hash the notice records and whose licence is CC0-1.0; it loads and MIDI renders
through it in Node and in headless Chromium. Its selection as a *default* remains the owner's listening approval (PB-10),
so a host that wants the bank off passes no bundled layer.

The AudioWorklet has its own SoundFont decoder instance. While a compressed bank awaits it, unrelated PCM, existing
voices and their controls continue; a replacement bank supersedes the pending bank. A voice is ready only when the worklet has opened it, so the cue player can
apply the late-start rule at the actual ready tick. If worklet decoder initialization fails, the player reports an
attempt to use a compressed bank and retains the previous bank; uncompressed banks and PCM remain available.
The worklet's ready reply supplies the voice duration to the renderer's timing mirror. Only the worklet opens and
seeks the audio source on that path. The renderer still reports instrument substitutions from the asset and bank metadata.
This does not describe the desktop page's separate decoder initialization, which currently fails the player startup
when it cannot initialize.

The **video** half is
[audio-media.md#video-request](audio-media.md#video-request): `VideoHost` answers every `playVideo` with exactly one `video.ended { reqId }`
(including every failure), keeps one video outstanding, and holds the other realised voices through the cue player's
`videoStarted`/`videoEnded` while the core's own restart cue returns the music. No VP9/WebM fixture ships yet, so the
lane proves the missing, undecodable and busy paths; the played path is entry 7's.

<a id="desktop-shell"></a>
## The desktop applications

There are **two desktop applications from one codebase**, and one ruled shell for both. The **player** is a
distribution artefact; the **editor** is its own package and application, with its own `platform-services`
instantiation, the harness embedded for preview, and its own update cadence. The player is not a stripped editor, the
editor is not a mode of the player, and neither is the PWA.

Both are **Electron 45.2.1** (Chromium 156.0.8078.75), ruled in [ADR 0013](../../adr/0013-desktop-shell-electron.md),
and both:

- serve every page over a **privileged `app://` scheme** — `standard`, `secure`, `supportFetchAPI`, `corsEnabled` —
  registered before `app.ready`, and never load a page with `loadFile`. A `file://` page cannot be trusted with the
  audio graph: in a system WebView it refuses `audioWorklet.addModule` under a cross-origin rule, and WebKit cannot
  register a service worker at all without a browser entitlement. The scheme is what keeps loading a game from an
  arbitrary path from being what breaks sound;
- register **no service worker**. A desktop application is already offline; the only artefact with a worker is the PWA
  ([offline](#offline));
- provide `platform-services`, an asset source for a folder or a package, and the save-blob host behind AD-17's keys.

**The player's window is its game.** Closing the player's last window exits the player application on every platform,
macOS included: the shell never stays alive with no window, and the process that launched the game ends with it
([E-06](main-loop-and-startup.md#e-06), where closing the engine's window exits the game).

On macOS, fullscreen follows the display that held the player window before the transition. If the native transition
lands on a different display and the intended display is still connected, the player restores the window's last bounds
and retries fullscreen once there (#1922).

**The player's launch resolution** is fixed, in this order, and is the only mechanism:

1. an explicit `--game <path>` argument, or a deep link;
2. a configuration file by convention — `player.json` beside the executable, or, when installed, in the operating
   system's configuration directory for the application;
3. an embedded default project baked in at export;
4. if none of those name a project, the installed-game library.

**The argument and the configuration file are exact.** `--game` names a distribution package file (`.tpk`), whose
descriptor is the sibling `<package>.tpk.json`. A deep link is `tkr://play?game=<percent-encoded path>`. `player.json`
carries `{ "schema": 1, "defaultGame": "<path>" }`: a relative `defaultGame` resolves against the directory that holds
`player.json`, an absolute one is taken as written, and a copy beside the executable wins over the one in the
configuration directory. On the desktop the library file is `library.json` in the application-data directory, shaped as
`library.schema = 1` in [launcher.md](launcher.md#storage-and-registry), and an entry is opened only after its `sha256`
and `size` match the package's bytes.

Handing somebody "the player plus my game" is therefore a pre-configured build or a configuration file, never a
per-game stub. There is **no file association to rely on**: an association is a promise the OS lets a user break and
does not exist in the PWA. A cold start with nothing configured shows the library and says why, never a blank window.

**The editor application** is epic `desktop-shell`'s (`host-desktop`): its own package, its own measurements, its own
signing/notarisation/updater and its own cadence. This page rules only what both applications share — the shell, the
scheme, the absence of a worker and the `platform-services` surface.

<a id="install"></a>
## Install, the library and the descriptor

A game is **data**, not an executable. An export writes a distribution package — a `.tpk`-compatible ZIP with
`manifest.json { schema, main, index }` — plus an **install descriptor**, and installing means **registering the package
with the player**, never wrapping it.

The library is a host-side registry, outside the save store: AD-17's blob keys are untouched. It holds each installed
package's identity (the manifest's `schema` and `main`, and the descriptor's `sha256` and `size`), its path on the
desktop or its OPFS handle on the web, that game's settings, and the **default game**. On the desktop it is a small
versioned JSON file in the application-data directory beside the installed packages; in the PWA it is a `library`
directory and index in OPFS, with Cache Storage left to the app shell under [offline](#offline).

Core stays I/O-free (G2): the application resolves a library entry and hands `core` the package's bytes through the
existing asset source. `core` never knows a registry exists, and an install is not a save.

The descriptor is a **sibling file** the exporter writes next to the package, `<package>.tpk.json`, with
`{ schema, file, sha256, size, gameId, title, version }` — see
[../formats/packaging-and-paths.md#install-descriptor](../formats/packaging-and-paths.md#install-descriptor). The
package's own manifest keeps exactly three fields, because AD-6 refuses any other.

<a id="load-modes"></a>
## Load modes and the threshold

The web player has two load modes. At or below the threshold it downloads the whole distribution package behind a
progress screen and keeps it. Above the threshold it validates the whole archive first, then discards nonessential
bytes and fetches entries on demand by validated ranges. **The first launch in streaming mode still transfers the
whole package**; it bounds retained memory rather than avoiding that initial download. Validation preserves the
archive's existing safety and integrity checks and verifies its size, SHA-256 and content-derived identity. This
behavior follows the owner's OQ1 approval for issue #934.

The threshold is **measured, not asserted**: it is the uncompressed size of the largest corpus package, including its
manifest, rounded up to the next whole mebibyte. The measurement builds packages from all games in the pinned fetched
corpus, using the closing plan to select each main file, and checks the resulting archives.

| Corpus | Largest package | Threshold | Measured |
|---|---|---|---|
| 8 fetched corpus games | ChimeranEmpire: 32175677 bytes | 31 MiB | 2026-11-01 |

A package in the cache is keyed by the SHA-256 of its bytes. Per-entry hashes and delta updates are deferred until a
second published package version exists, because they would otherwise amend AD-6 and the manifest contract for a
benefit no artefact can use.

<a id="prefetch"></a>
## Prefetch hints

The **core** computes the deterministic prefetch plan and sends it as tiered hints at the AD-5 seam; a runner only
fetches and decodes ahead. A runner **MUST NOT** parse a board to guess what to prefetch — that duplicates the board
reader in every host.

| Tier | What is in it |
|---|---|
| `now` | the current board's resolved `bkgMusic`, and the default bank when that music is MIDI |
| `next` | the resolved music of edge-linked boards whose bytes are already cached, excluding program links; the current battle background's nonempty `music`, `menuMoveSound`, `menuChooseSound`, `readySound` and `cantDoSound` fields when available |
| `always` | the main file's `cursorMoveSound`, `cursorSelectSound` and `cursorCancelSound`, and the default bank |

The planner does not currently hint other current-board assets, animation frame sounds, or literal `send(...)` targets.
It deduplicates keys across tiers, keeping the earliest tier, and sorts keys within each tier. The battle background may
need a separate prefetch-only asset request before its sound fields become available. Such a request never blocks
ticking or loading; a late successful reply emits a changed plan when its facts are ready. A missing or undecodable
reply is remembered as unavailable for the engine session and is not requested again. An undecodable reply reports an
`asset.invalid` diagnostic with the key and parser error; it does not stop the engine. This prefetch-only negative
cache is not saved and is excluded from state and draw hashes. It does not prevent a separate gameplay asset request.

A hint **never blocks**, **never changes state**, **never appears in a state or draw hash**, and **never earns a reply**.
Because it never blocks, a runner must dispatch a hint before it awaits any blocking reply; a hint and a blocking
asset request for the same key in the same report must share the hint's origin read, not the request's. The wire record
is an AD-5 and AD-17 amendment, added by entry 8. The owner approved this correction to the landed planner's behavior on
2026-11-01 (issue #934, OQ4); it supersedes the broader proposed table in
[audio-media.md#audio-prefetch](audio-media.md#audio-prefetch).

The web runner reports one diagnostic about hints, `shared`: the keys whose audio-cue read was served by a read that a
hint began. In plain terms, it is evidence that a prefetch hint, and not an eager package, a blocking request or the cue
itself, did the loading a cue then used. Technically a key is recorded only when the cue's own read of it, at that
moment, found bytes in the cache or joined a read still in flight **and** those bytes came from a read that a hint
started. A hint that names a key whose bytes were already cached, or whose read a blocking request or a cue had already
started, earns no credit; neither do bytes the cache no longer holds (replaced or evicted and fetched again) or a read
that failed. It is evidence a test can assert, not a performance metric, and like every hint it changes no state, hash or
reply.

## The PWA and offline play

The PWA is the web player, and it is the **only artefact this epic ships with a service worker**; the editor PWA is
`host-web`'s and its worker is epic `editor-foundation`'s. Neither desktop application registers one.

The worker caches the app shell, the bundled default bank and the whole-package download, and it updates on the **next
launch** and **never** mid-session. Save blobs go through `saveBlob` / `loadBlob` / `listBlobs` under `GameId`-keyed
paths and the worker never reads a save. The runner **SHOULD** call `navigator.storage.persist()` and **MUST** report an
unpersisted or quota-limited state rather than swallowing it, falling back to streaming for anything it cannot keep. No
background sync, push, accounts or telemetry are added.

<a id="mobile"></a>
## The mobile wrapper

`runner-mobile` is the `runner-web` build inside **Capacitor 8.5.3** and nothing else: it proves one sample game on a
real device or emulator and carries the same asset source and the same AD-17 blob keys, with the Capacitor filesystem
behind them. Store submission, signing, icons, splash screens, deep links and per-platform chrome are out of scope and
belong to a release owner that does not exist yet.

The wrapper **MUST NOT** fork the player: a platform difference is a host service or a policy on this page, never a
second rendering or input path. Host blob persistence records existence (`save.blobPresent`) and write confirmation
(`save.written`). The mobile wrapper confirms its initial save blob upon session startup and preserves it across
restarts; it writes this startup save blob once and **MUST NOT** dispatch recurring filesystem bridge writes on
subsequent animation frames or game ticks.

<a id="build"></a>
## Build and artefact shape

The browser artefacts are bundled with **esbuild 0.28.2** — the bundler AD-22 names for `host-vscode`, MIT licensed.
Vite **MUST NOT** be installed: it pulls `lightningcss` (MPL-2.0) and would need its own ADR before a first install, and
nothing here needs HMR. See [ADR 0015](../../adr/0015-web-build-and-test-toolchain.md).

The engine worker and the AudioWorklet are **single-file IIFE bundles with no runtime `import()`**. The player page is a
static HTML file plus one bundle, served in development and in the browser tests by a small static server; no framework
and no dev server enters the shipped artefact. The same `tsc -b` output feeds the browser bundle and the headless runner,
which is what "the same core build" in the capability's success check means.

<a id="csp-and-banks"></a>
## CSP and the audio path

The desktop player can receive an SF3 bank, including one named `.sf2`. Its MIDI dependency eagerly initializes the
WebAssembly Vorbis decoder even when the bundled uncompressed SF2 is used. The desktop player and measurement page
therefore allow `wasm-unsafe-eval` in `script-src`; this permits WebAssembly compilation but not JavaScript
`unsafe-eval`. The policy still permits scripts only from the application's own origin. The decoder supports
compressed SoundFont samples; the interactive player waits for its initialization before starting audio, and reports
initialization failure rather than silently playing a compressed sample before the decoder is ready.

The browser player's strict policy is unchanged, and its browser lane **MUST** assert that the default path instantiates
no WebAssembly. Because the dependency initialises its decoder at import time, bundling it would break that promise even
when only the bundled uncompressed SF2 is played, so the browser and mobile builds exclude it: the decoder is aliased to a
stub whose readiness resolves and whose `decode` refuses, and SF3 cannot be played in the browser
([issue #1325](https://github.com/tk-reawakened/rpgtoolkit-reawakened/issues/1325)). The lane proves it by instrumenting
`WebAssembly` before any page script runs. SF3 playback on other runners is not established by the desktop result.

The AudioWorklet module is loaded by `audioWorklet.addModule` from a **same-origin** URL — `/apps/browser/audio-worklet.js` in
the browser, `/apps/mobile/audio-worklet.js` on mobile (including Capacitor's HTTPS origin), and
`app://player/apps/desktop/audio-worklet.js` under the desktop scheme. That fetch is governed by `script-src`, not
`worker-src`. Each host build emits its bundles and manifests under its own `apps/<host>/` directory, and the
build-output check rejects any path claimed by multiple host builds. The browser service worker retains its registered
`/apps/service-worker.js` URL for existing clients; its precache manifest and all other browser artifacts are under
`apps/browser/`. The browser lane loads its module under the real CSP; the desktop smoke does the same over `app://`.

<a id="conformance-lane"></a>
## Conformance: the schema and the vector kit

A runner proves itself by replaying vectors, not by sharing types. Two artefacts do that:

- **the schemas** — `packages/runner-harness/schema/runner-protocol-v{1,2,3}.schema.json`, one strict, separately
  identified JSON Schema per published version. V3 is current; v1 and v2 remain historical and unchanged. A
  non-TypeScript runner selects and validates against the version it supports;
- **the vector kit** — `tools/fixtures/runner-protocol/`, a generator with a `--check` mode on the
  `audio-protocol:check` pattern. It holds one record per kind across the three families — a draw list, an input record and
  a host request — each with the verdict a conforming schema must return, plus the refusals a runner must reject (an
  unknown kind, an omitted required key, an out-of-range value, a non-`https:` URL). A runner passes by validating and
  replaying them.

<a id="drift-check"></a>
The historical v1 and v2 schemas, TypeScript frame types and vector kits remain fixed together; v3 is the current version. **`pnpm runner-protocol:check`** checks each independently, including v2 rejecting v3 and v3 rejecting missing or unsupported markers. For each contract it reports every problem it finds:

1. **The kits are reproducible.** Each version's generator checks its own committed vector bytes and schema.
2. **The schema is well formed.** Every `$ref` resolves, every `$defs` entry is reachable from the three roots
   (`drawList`, `inputRecord`, `request`), every object is closed (`additionalProperties: false`) with every `required`
   key declared, and only the JSON Schema keywords the checker evaluates appear, so a keyword it would silently ignore
   cannot weaken the schema.
3. **The schema and the kit agree.** Every vector's verdict matches what the schema returns: a valid record is accepted
   and a refusal is refused. A kit that holds no valid record for some kind the schema lists fails.
   The v1 check also requires the schema to reject a representative v2 semantic `action` record, without changing the frozen v1 vector kit.
4. **Schemas and TypeScript types agree.** The check compares `DrawListV1`, `DrawListV2` and current `DrawList`
   against their respective schemas, with the appropriate historical or current input union and `RunnerRequest`.
   It recursively checks required keys, literals and enums, `null`, arrays, records and nested objects, projecting
   `Uint8Array` leaves as base64 strings. It names every difference. Numeric bounds, string patterns and lengths
   exist only in the schema (TypeScript has no integer type), so refusal vectors enforce them. V1's input union is
   intentionally narrower than the current input union.

`packages/core` also fails its own type check when a request kind is missing from `HOST_REQUEST_KINDS`, so a request
kind cannot be added to the wire without being declarable by a package. The same check, plus perturbation tests that
prove schema-only, TypeScript-only and vector-only changes each fail, run under `pnpm fixtures:test`.

The browser lane is **Playwright 1.64.0** (Apache-2.0, Blue Oak Gold), one headless Chromium project, a required `gate`
dependency that runs `pnpm fixtures:fetch` first and serves the fetched `fixtures/` folder over the local static server.
Its licence, and why it is a dev-only tool outside the production-tree scan, are recorded in
[ADR 0015](../../adr/0015-web-build-and-test-toolchain.md). No test reaches the network.
